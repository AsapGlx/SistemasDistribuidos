00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,500
So, this,

344
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,458
this isn't the first time
we've had this conversation, is it?

345
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,916
- How did you know?
- I know about the slipping.

346
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,833
And who do you think paved that road?

347
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,750
Any guesses? Survey says...

348
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,500
He Who Remains.

349
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,750
Bingo!

350
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,333
Here you were, slipping through time.

351
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,791
Thinking you were,
you were sticking it to the system.

352
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,833
Gonna beat the man. And then... Whoop!

353
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,375
Here he is.

354
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:44,083
Kiddo, did you really think I was just
gonna sit back and let her kill me?

355
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,250
And that'd be it? Zip? Nada?

356
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,208
RIP HWR?

357
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,958
(LAUGHS) No, I told you.

358
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,125
Reincarnation, baby.

359
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,750
"We die with the dying.

360
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,291
"We're born with the dead."

361
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,833
Uh-huh. Okay. So, this is a lot for you.

362
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:18,250
I get it. So why don't you just go through
this a couple thousand more times?

363
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,375
Get your bearings.

364
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,333
And then you just, you just let me know.

365
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,583
Okay, when you're ready
to have a conversation.

366
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,708
Okay?

367
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,208
And what makes you think...

368
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,000
this is the first time
we've had this conversation?

369
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,291
Tsst.

370
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,958
Well done. You're my favorite.

371
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,101
When there was two of you here,
you were my favorite.

372
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,916
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

373
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,958
So, seems you've figured it all out. Hmm?

374
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,625
Tell me, how is Victor...
(IMITATES STUTTER) Timely?

375
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,250
- Of course you know about your...
- Wait. Don't tell me.

376
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:23,000
You're, you're having some, some,
some problems with the Temporal Loom.

377
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,125
- Scaling problem.
- Scaling problem? That's what he told you?

378
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,416
Victor told you
it's a scaling problem? Wow.

379
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,625
No. No, there's no, there's no problem.

380
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,875
It destroyed the TVA.

381
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,375
The Temporal Loom is a failsafe.

382
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:45,166
When the Loom is overloaded with branches,

383
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,250
it deletes the ones
that aren't supposed to be there.

384
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:54,416
Everything except the Sacred Timeline.

385
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,416
- (CHUCKLES)
- And the TVA,

386
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,142
that's just,
that's just collateral damage.

387
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,583
Look, no biggie. Easy to rebuild.

388
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,708
- What a waste of time.
- And as you may or may not know,

389
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,958
my Variants are already out there.

390
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,041
We'll find them.

391
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,875
- There's too many.
- I won't stop.

392
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,833
- Doesn't matter.
- Never stopped me before.

393
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,166
I know, champ.

394
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:25,208
But the outcome to this equation remains,

395
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,791
remains the same.

396
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,666
You lose.

397
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,041
I know.

398
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,208
I know.

399
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,083
Shake it off.

400
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,041
I'll change the equation.

401
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll break your Loom.

402
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:14,833
Um... But the Loom prevents a brutal war

403
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:19,458
where nothing survives, Loki.
Not even the Sacred Timeline.

404
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:25,041
Okay, let's try it this way, every...

405
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,666
every moment of peace

406
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,125
you've ever experienced

407
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:37,083
was yours because I was here.

408
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:39,625
Alone,

409
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,000
at the end of time,

410
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,333
keeping watch.

411
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,208
I understand.

412
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,875
But you want to break the Loom.

413
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,083
What do you think would happen
to your friends?

414
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,166
Hmm.

415
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:06,041
I made the tough choices.
That's why I get the big chair.

416
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,041
I keep us safe.

417
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,666
Can't you see what I'm offering here...

418
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,250
is mercy?

419
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:24,458
For me, or for you?

420
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,083
(LOKI SIGHS)

421
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:30,916
No.

422
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,041
I'll find another way.

423
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:43,416
Okay.

424
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:55,458
And around and around and around we go.

425
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,208
Let's see it.

426
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,958
Make the hard choice.

427
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:05,208
Break the Loom and you cause a war
that kills us all. Game over.

428
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,166
Or, kill her,

429
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:13,291
and we protect what we can.

430
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,958
MOBIUS: What are you gonna do?

431
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,666
- Finish what I started.
- MOBIUS: Which is?

432
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,291
- Claim my throne.
- You wanna be king?

433
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,250
I don't want to be, I was born to be.

434
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,000
I know, but king of what, exactly?

435
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,416
Okay, so let's get into it.
The man who would be king...

436
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,583
- No, Mobius, stop.
- Stop? We just started.

437
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,375
- We gotta keep going.
- No, no, no.

438
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,791
I know what this is.

439
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,166
What is it?

440
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,166
You want to know what makes Loki tick?

441
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,291
Yes.

442
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,416
You want to know why I do what I do?

443
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,875
Why I have so much range?

444
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,333
Yeah.

445
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,791
You're gonna make notes,

446
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:09,708
and then you're gonna click that button
on that machine

447
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:13,625
and then you're gonna play out scenes
from my whole life,

448
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,666
how it's all meant to be,
past, present, future.

449
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,666
Burdened with glorious purpose.

450
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,041
My life was a waste of time.

451
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:24,375
Okay, it looks like someone
got a hold of the set list.

452
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,000
- How are you doing this?
- Mobius, I need your help.

453
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,541
Well, I'm listening.

454
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,541
How do you choose who lives and who dies?

455
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:38,000
Prune. We prune around here
and we don't choose the Time-Keepers,

456
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,291
- they have that responsibility.
- The Time-Keepers.

457
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,833
Dictate the proper flow of time.

458
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,833
They're busy untangling the epilogue
from its infinite branches.

459
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,791
- Exactly, yeah.
- I know the dogma,

460
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,791
but really, you're the one doing it.

461
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:52,125
Because it was the proper flow of time.

462
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,625
- What comfort is that?
- Comfort? Well, there's no comfort.

463
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,208
You're not gonna find comfort at the TVA.

464
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,833
You wanna hear a good story?
Listen to this one.

465
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:05,416
A couple of Hunters went out on a mission
somewhere near the Black Sea

466
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,166
to find a Variant who's gonna be
responsible for 5,000 deaths,

467
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,875
5,000 deaths that were not
in the proper flow of time.

468
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,708
They get there
and there's a little hiccup.

469
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,791
The Variant is an eight-year-old boy.

470
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,791
He was just minding his own business.

471
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,833
Swimming with his brother,
jumping off the dock.

472
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,416
And one of the Hunters
who never had trouble pruning before,

473
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,125
he had never hesitated,
but that day he did.

474
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,541
He paused.

475
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,833
Timeline started to branch,
more Variants appeared.

476
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,916
Happened so fast, his partner
had to step in and prune the kid.

477
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,083
But by then, cat was out of the bag.

478
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,583
Couple Hunters died.

479
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,375
All because that one Hunter,

480
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,375
he lost sight of the big picture.

481
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,250
Gotta keep the big picture in mind.

482
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,750
Hmm.

483
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:06,416
Most purpose is more burden than glory.

484
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,875
And trust me,
you never wanna be the guy who avoids it

485
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,875
'cause you can't live with the burden.

486
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:17,958
How do you live with it?

487
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,000
Scar tissue.

488
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,666
What happened to your partner?

489
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,875
The Hunter who pruned the boy
when you couldn't.

490
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,208
Oh, things worked out fine for her.

491
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,750
She actually became a judge.

492
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:43,500
You know, she's the reason you're here
instead of dust in a TVA vent.

493
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,916
Renslayer.

494
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,416
She knew the hard thing to do
was the thing that had to be done.

495
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,791
And by hard, I mean impossible.

496
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,125
No, there's no comfort.

497
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,583
You just choose your burden.

498
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,791
Thank you, Mobius.

499
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,000
HUNTER B-15: Is this it?

500
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,083
We... (WHIMPERS)

501
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,333
(SCREAMS)

502
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,041
There's nowhere left to go.

503
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,000
What's happening?

504
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,125
We're outside time.

505
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,541
How?

506
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,041
I finally learned to control
the time slipping.

507
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,625
I went back.

508
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,833
I thought I could fix the Loom.

509
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,333
It's a failsafe.

510
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,583
It was designed to protect
the Sacred Timeline and nothing else.

511
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,125
Of course it is.

512
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,458
I'm out of options, Sylvie.

513
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,916
I've tried everything.

514
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,541
The only way that anything survives...

515
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:54,208
Is if I never kill He Who Remains
in the first place.

516
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,416
So you have to kill me.

517
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,916
