1
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,514
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,717
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,653
As we begin, I believe you have

4
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,688
a statement to read
into the record.

5
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,725
Yes, Your Honor.

6
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,861
We're
not judges, Doctor.

7
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:33,929
No.

8
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,430
Of course.

9
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:44,572
Members of the security board,

10
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,909
the so-called
derogatory information

11
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:49,845
in your indictment of me
cannot be fairly understood,

12
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:53,714
except in the context
of my life and my work.

13
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,919
How
long did he testify?

14
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:58,686
Honestly, I forget.

15
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:02,057
The whole hearing took a month.

16
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,524
An ordeal, hmm?

17
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,227
Well, I've only read
the transcripts.

18
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,530
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

19
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,798
You weren't there?

20
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:13,135
As chairman, I
wasn't allowed to be.

21
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,736
Are they really going
to ask about it?

22
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,873
- It was years ago.
- Four years ago...

23
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:18,941
Five.

24
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,542
Oppenheimer still
divides America.

25
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,946
The committee is gonna want
to know where you stood.

26
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,081
Senator Thurmond asked me to say

27
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:27,950
not to feel that
you're on trial.

28
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:31,519
Oh, funny, I didn't
till you just said that.

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,155
- Really, Mr. Strauss...
- It's Admiral.

30
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:36,124
Um, Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.

31
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:38,659
President Eisenhower has asked
you to be in his cabinet.

32
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,561
Senate really has no
choice but to confirm you.

33
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,831
And if they bring
up Oppenheimer?

34
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:45,233
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

35
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,668
No senator can deny
you did your duty.

36
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,838
It'll be uncomfortable.

37
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:52,007
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

38
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:59,647
Why did you
leave the United States?

39
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,153
I, uh... I wanted to
study the new physics.

40
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:06,721
Was there nowhere here?

41
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,756
I thought Berkeley
had the leading

42
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,624
theoretical physics department.

43
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,228
Yes. Once I built it.

44
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,863
But first I had to go to Europe.

45
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:18,266
I went to Cambridge to study
under Patrick Blackett.

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,902
Were you happier
there than in America?

47
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:23,071
- Happier?
- Yes.

48
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:30,045
No. No, I, uh...

49
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:34,883
<i>I was homesick, um...</i>

50
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,718
emotionally immature...

51
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:44,026
<i>troubled by visions
of a hidden universe.</i>

52
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,905
Useless in the lab.

53
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,046
Christ, Oppenheimer.

54
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,148
Have you had any sleep?

55
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,184
Start again.

56
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:11,719
I need to go to
the lecture, sir.

57
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,155
Why?

58
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:15,090
It's Niels Bohr.

59
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,593
Damn,
completely forgot.

60
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,830
All right. Let's go.

61
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,077
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.

62
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,211
You finish coating those plates.

63
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:29,071
You see them?

64
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,610
Don't
forget to clean up!

65
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,712
<i>Quantum physics
is not a step forward,</i>

66
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,250
it is a new way to
understand reality.

67
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:18,854
Einstein's opened the door,
now we are peering through,

68
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,789
seeing a world inside our world.

69
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:27,229
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

70
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:10,771
Yeah, definitely.

71
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,174
Are you all right?

72
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,243
Niels, meet J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

73
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,777
What's the
"J" stand for?

74
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,779
Nothing, apparently.

75
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:19,915
You were at my lecture.

76
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:21,349
You asked the only
good question.

77
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:23,118
No one's
denying his insight.

78
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,229
It's his laboratory work that
leaves a little to be desired.

79
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,093
I heard you
give the same lecture...

80
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:30,325
At Harvard, yes, and you
asked the same question.

81
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,459
Why ask again?

82
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,094
Hadn't liked your answer.

83
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,198
Did you like it
better yesterday?

84
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,499
A lot.

85
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:39,434
You can lift the stone
without being ready

86
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,836
for the snake that's revealed.

87
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,005
Now it seems you're ready.

88
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,341
But you don't enjoy the lab?

89
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:49,244
So get out of Cambridge with
its beakers and potions.

90
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:52,247
Go somewhere they let you think.

91
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:54,883
Where?

92
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:56,518
Göttingen.

93
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,486
- Born?
- Born.

94
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,488
Get to Germany,
study under Max Born.

95
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:03,158
Learn the ways of theory.

96
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,226
I'll send word.

97
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,963
Wormhole.

98
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:09,364
How's your mathematics?

99
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:11,366
Not good enough for the
physicist he wants to be.

100
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,969
Algebra's like sheet music.

101
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,471
The important thing isn't
"Can you read music?"

102
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,505
It's "Can you hear it?"

103
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:20,842
Can you hear the music, Robert?

104
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,378
Yes, I can.

105
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,608
The senator from Wyoming.

106
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:04,045
Admiral Strauss, I'm
interested in your relationship

107
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,948
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

108
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,583
You met him in 1947?

109
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,584
Correct.

110
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,386
You were commissioner

111
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,987
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

112
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:16,958
I was, but I-I actually
met Robert in my capacity

113
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,661
as board member of the
Institute for Advanced Study

114
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:21,496
at Princeton because

115
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,165
after the war, he
was world-renowned

116
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:26,601
as the great man of physics,
and I was determined

117
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,337
to get him to run the Institute.

118
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:41,583
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

119
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:42,951
Mr. Strauss.

120
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,285
It's pronounced "straws."

121
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:46,654
Oh-ppenheimer,
Oppenheimer.

122
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:48,556
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

123
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,694
I'm president of Temple
Emanu-El in Manhattan.

124
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,996
"Straws" is just the
Southern pronunciation.

125
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,064
- Ah.
- Anyway,

126
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,532
welcome to the Institute.

127
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,200
I think you could
be very happy here.

128
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:01,169
Yes, well, you'll
love the commute.

129
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,537
The position comes
with that house

130
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,038
for you and your wife

131
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,241
and your, is it two children?

132
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,075
Yes, two.

133
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,044
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

134
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,280
And you're a physicist
by training, Mr. Strauss?

135
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,382
I'm sorry, uh,
common room 4:00 tea.

136
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,185
No, I'm not trained in
physics or anything else.

137
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,053
- I'm a self-made man.
- Ah.

138
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,089
- I can relate to that.
- Really?

139
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,458
Yes, my father was one.

140
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:27,061
And this would be your office.

141
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,173
I'm told he's there
most afternoons.

142
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:40,308
You know, I've always wondered

143
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:43,945
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

144
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:48,216
Greatest scientific
mind of our time.

145
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:50,118
Of his time.

146
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,187
Einstein published his
Theory of Relativity

147
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,156
more than 40 years ago now.

148
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:58,660
But never embraced the
quantum world it revealed.

149
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,228
"God doesn't play dice."

150
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,230
Precisely.

151
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:05,066
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

152
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,469
Well, I had offers, but
I chose to sell shoes.

153
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:11,005
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

154
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:13,675
No, just a shoe salesman.

155
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,977
Huh.

156
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,014
- I'd love to introduce you.
- No need.

157
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,584
I have known him for years.

158
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,507
Albert.

159
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:54,315
What was that? What
did you say to him?

160
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,485
Oh, he's fine.

161
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:02,657
Mr. Strauss, there
are things in my past

162
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,192
you ought to be aware of.

163
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,127
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

164
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,629
I have access to
your security file.

165
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:08,663
I've read it.

166
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:10,265
- You're not worried?
- No.

167
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:11,675
Why would I be worried
after everything

168
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,167
you've done for your country?

169
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,669
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

170
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:16,538
Well, the purpose
of this institute

171
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,240
is to provide a haven
for independent minds.

172
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:23,177
That's you. You are
the man for the job.

173
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,814
Well, then I'll consider it.

174
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,116
I'll see you at the
AEC meeting tomorrow.

175
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,088
This is one of the
most prestigious

176
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,858
appointments in the country.

177
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,092
Yes, with a great commute.

178
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:40,428
That's why I'm considering it.

179
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,230
<i>So,
Dr. Oppenheimer brought</i>

180
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,666
<i>your attention to
his past associations</i>

181
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:45,834
<i>before you appointed him?</i>

182
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,302
Yes.

183
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,170
And it didn't concern you?

184
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,738
Just then, I was
entirely consumed

185
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:54,542
with what he must have said
to Einstein to sour him on me.

186
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,347
But later?

187
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,316
Well, we all know
what happened later.

188
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:03,718
Doctor, your, uh...
your time in Europe,

189
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,320
you seemed to meet
with a wide range

190
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:06,788
of other countries' physicists.

191
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:07,823
Yes, that's right.

192
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,124
Any Russians?

193
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,627
None that spring to mind.

194
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,563
If you'll just allow me to
continue with my statement...

195
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:18,566
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.

196
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:23,738
After Göttingen, I
moved on to Leiden in Holland

197
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:26,809
<i>where I first met Isidor Rabi.</i>

198
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:29,344
Excuse me.

199
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:35,617
A Yank, lecturing
on the new physics?

200
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,718
This I have to hear.

201
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,786
I'm an American myself.

202
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,321
How surprising.

203
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:41,422
Um...

204
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:43,725
Let me know if you need
any help with the English.

205
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,674
Wait, what's he saying?

206
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:11,252
No, thank you.

207
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,254
It's a long way to Zurich.

208
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,927
You get any skinnier,
we're gonna lose you

209
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,791
between the seat cushions.

210
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm Rabi.

211
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:19,260
Oppenheimer.

212
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,329
I caught your
lecture on molecules.

213
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,497
Caught some of it.

214
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:25,800
We're a couple of New York
Jews. How do you know Dutch?

215
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,402
Well, I thought
I'd better learn it

216
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:28,612
when I got here this semester.

217
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,238
You learned enough
Dutch in six weeks

218
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,974
to give a lecture on
quantum mechanics?

219
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:33,508
Wanted to challenge myself.

220
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,911
Quantum physics wasn't
challenging enough.

221
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:37,679
<i>- Schvitzer.
- Schvitzer?</i>

222
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,614
Show-off.

223
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,492
Dutch in six weeks, but
you never learned Yiddish?

224
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,584
They don't speak it so
much my side of the park.

225
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,686
Screw you.

226
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,288
You homesick?

227
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,723
Oh, you know it.

228
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,694
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

229
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:53,795
Physicists?

230
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:55,329
'S funny.

231
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:57,432
Not in the department.

232
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,766
They're all Jewish too.

233
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:02,270
Eat.

234
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,708
There's a German you
have to seek out.

235
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,278
- Heisenberg.
- Right.

236
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:20,956
One might be led
to the presumption

237
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,458
that behind the quantum world,

238
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:27,361
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

239
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:29,597
but such speculation seem to us,

240
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,366
to say it explicitly,
fruitless. Thank you.

241
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,836
Have a great day.

242
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,742
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

243
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,010
Dr. Oppenheimer.

244
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:43,979
Oppenheimer, yes.

245
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,881
I liked your paper on molecules.

246
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:47,415
Probably because
you inspired it.

247
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,960
If I inspire anything
else, let me know.

248
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:50,024
We could publish together.

249
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:51,887
I have to get back to America.

250
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,654
Why? There's no one there

251
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:55,891
taking quantum
mechanics seriously.

252
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:57,525
That's exactly why.

253
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,995
He's pining for the
canyons of Manhattan.

254
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,463
Canyons of New Mexico.

255
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:03,640
- You're from New Mexico?
- No.

256
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,767
New York, but my brother
and I have a ranch

257
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,903
outside Santa Fe.

258
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:10,304
That's the America
I miss right now.

259
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,406
Then it's best you
get home, cowboys.

260
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,052
That's him.

261
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:17,512
No, me and horses.
I don't think so.

262
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,680
Nice to meet you.

263
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,551
Did you ever encounter
Heisenberg again?

264
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,487
Not in person, no, but, uh...

265
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:29,825
you might say our paths crossed.

266
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:33,594
On returning to America,
I accepted positions

267
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:36,364
at both Caltech
and up at Berkeley.

268
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:41,702
I got it,
it's all right.

269
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,456
Dr. Lawrence,
I presume?

270
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:05,093
You must be Oppenheimer.

271
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:06,661
Yes.

272
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,031
I hear you want to start a
school of quantum theory.

273
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:10,731
I am starting it. Next door.

274
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:12,600
- They put you in there?
- I asked for it.

275
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,702
Wanted to be close to
you experimentalists.

276
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:17,105
Theory will get you
only so far, huh?

277
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:19,107
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

278
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,844
- Magnificent.
- Would you like to help?

279
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:23,711
Build it? Oh, no.

280
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:24,847
No, no.

281
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,448
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

282
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,492
When do you start teaching?

283
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:30,384
I've got my first in an hour.

284
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,420
- Seminar?
- Pupil.

285
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:35,690
One student? That's it?

286
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:38,459
I'm teaching something no
one here has dreamt of.

287
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,504
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it...

288
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,997
There's no going back.

289
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,467
- Oh. I must have missed the...
- Ah. Lo...

290
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,502
- Mr. Lomanitz?
- Na.

291
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:50,605
Yeah.

292
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,740
Yes, this is it. Please.

293
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:53,842
Take a seat.

294
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,514
What do you know about
quantum mechanics?

295
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,918
I have a grasp on the basics.

296
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,518
Then you're doing it wrong.

297
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,023
Is light made up of
particles or waves?

298
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:09,200
Quantum mechanics
says it's both.

299
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:10,826
How could it be both?

300
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,760
- It can't.
- It can't.

301
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:17,665
But it is. It's paradoxical,
and yet, it works.

302
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:25,807
Now.

303
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,644
Thank you.

304
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:32,680
Mr. Lomanitz. You're
gonna be okay.

305
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,082
Mr. Snyder.

306
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,650
Now let's consider a star.

307
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:39,221
A star. A vast furnace
burning in outer space,

308
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:42,657
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

309
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,126
Balanced.

310
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:46,460
But if that furnace cools...

311
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,831
and gravity starts
winning, it contracts.

312
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:51,799
Density increases.

313
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,035
Correct.

314
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,236
Increasing gravity.

315
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,770
Increasing density.

316
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,940
- And?
- It's a vicious cycle until...

317
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:59,607
what's the limit here?

318
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,011
I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

319
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,822
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

320
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:06,747
Me?

321
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,951
Yes, you. Your math
is better than mine.

322
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:12,787
<i>Dr. Oppenheimer's file</i>

323
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:15,223
<i>contained detail of his
activities in Berkeley.</i>

324
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,724
Why would they
have started a file

325
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:19,694
on Dr. Oppenheimer
before the war?

326
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:22,197
Well, you'd have
to ask Mr. Hoover.

327
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,099
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

328
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:27,069
Uh, my assumption is that

329
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:30,238
it was connected to his, uh,

330
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:32,808
left-wing political activities.

331
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,585
You shouldn't
let them bring up politics

332
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,945
in the classroom, Oppie.

333
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:38,713
I wrote that.

334
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:42,017
Lawrence, you embrace the
revolution in physics.

335
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,852
Can't you see it
everywhere else?

336
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:45,988
Picasso, Stravinsky,
Freud, Marx.

337
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:47,621
Well, this
is America, Oppie.

338
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,024
We had our revolution.

339
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,660
Seriously, keep
it out of the lab.

340
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,796
Well, out of the
lab, my landlady

341
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:58,632
is having a discussion
group tonight. Interested?

342
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,735
I have sampled the
Berkeley political scene.

343
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,804
It's all just
philosophy post-grads

344
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:05,140
and Communists
talking integration.

345
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:06,842
You don't care
about integration.

346
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,743
I want to vote for
it, not talk about it.

347
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:10,778
'Specially on a Friday.
Come on, let's eat.

348
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,148
I'm meeting
my brother there.

349
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,059
<i>And how
would these activities</i>

350
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,218
<i>have come to the attention</i>

351
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,252
of the FBI?

352
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:19,254
Well, if I remember correctly,

353
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:21,223
the FBI was taking
license plates

354
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:23,591
outside suspected
Communist gatherings,

355
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,626
<i>and his name popped up.</i>

356
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,735
- Gotcha!
- Jesus Christ.

357
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,072
- Sorry. Hi, brother.
- Frank.

358
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:39,808
Uh, you remember Jackie.

359
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,309
Evening.

360
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,311
Let's go. Come.

361
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:45,914
Right over there,
right over there.

362
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:49,851
Robert. I want you
to meet Chevalier.

363
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:53,587
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

364
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,789
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

365
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,124
This is my little
brother, Frank.

366
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:57,359
- And this is...
- Hello.

367
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,327
- Still Jackie.
- Hello, Still Jackie.

368
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,329
Chevalier, you're in languages?

369
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,098
And your reputation
precedes you.

370
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,866
- What have you heard?
- Excuse me.

371
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,676
That you're teaching a radical
new approach to physics

372
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,945
I have no chance
of understanding,

373
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,347
but I hadn't heard
you're a Party member.

374
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:11,672
- Uh, I'm not.
- Oh, not yet.

375
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,683
Frank and I are thinking of
joining. Just the other day,

376
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,353
- I was saying...
- I support a range of causes.

377
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:17,012
The
Spanish Civil War?

378
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:18,779
A democratic republic
being overthrown

379
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:20,115
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

380
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,817
Our government.

381
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,327
They think that socialism is
a bigger threat than fascism.

382
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,853
Not for long.

383
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:26,687
Look at what the Nazis
are doing to the Jews.

384
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,291
I send funds to colleagues
in Germany to emigrate.

385
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:31,359
I have to do something.

386
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:34,762
My own work
is so abstract.

387
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,364
What are you working on?

388
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:38,333
What happens to the
stars when they die.

389
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:39,800
Do stars die?

390
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,304
Well, if they do,

391
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:44,239
they'd cool, then collapse.

392
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:46,908
In fact, the bigger the star,

393
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:49,643
<i>the more violent its demise.</i>

394
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,213
The gravity gets so concentrated

395
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:54,216
it swallows everything.

396
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:55,217
Everything, even light.

397
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,418
Can that really happen?

398
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:58,253
The math says it can.

399
00:21:58,286 --> 00:21:59,720
If we can get published,

400
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,332
then perhaps one day,
an astronomer finds one.

401
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:03,091
But right now, all
I have is theory,

402
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,993
which can't impact
people's lives.

403
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:07,295
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

404
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,897
do it through the
Communist Party.

405
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,274
They can get it to
the front lines.

406
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,700
Mary sent me with these.

407
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:16,204
- I'm Jean.
- Robert.

408
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:17,738
Haakon Chevalier.

409
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,317
The union meeting at
Serber's last month?

410
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:20,741
Right, right, yes.

411
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,144
Oh, thank you.

412
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,412
Robert here
says he's not a Communist.

413
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,747
Well, then he doesn't
know enough about it.

414
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,151
Oh, I've read <i>Das Kapital,</i>
all three volumes.

415
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,819
Does that count?

416
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,830
It would make you better
read than most party members.

417
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:35,157
Turgid stuff. There's
some thinking, um,

418
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,358
"Ownership is theft."

419
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:38,293
- "Property."
- "Property"?

420
00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:40,128
"Property," not "ownership."

421
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:42,197
I'm sorry, I read it
in the original German.

422
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,900
Well.

423
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,135
It's not about the book.

424
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,172
It's about the ideas. And
you sound uncommitted.

425
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:51,840
Well, I'm committed
to thinking freely

426
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:54,309
about how to improve our world.

427
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:56,444
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

428
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:59,447
You're a physicist, you
pick and choose rules?

429
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,049
Or do you use the discipline

430
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:03,218
to channel your
energies into progress?

431
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,654
I like a little wiggle room.

432
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:08,957
Do you always tow
the party line?

433
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:12,093
I like my wiggle room too.

434
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:24,772
What?

435
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:25,974
Wait, wait, wait.

436
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:31,479
Unexpected.

437
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:33,415
- What?
- For a physicist.

438
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:36,218
You only have a
shelf full of Freud?

439
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:39,120
Well, actually, my
background's more...

440
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:40,989
Uh, Jungian?

441
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,225
You know analysis?

442
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:45,793
When I was in
post-grad at Cambridge,

443
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:47,128
I had a little trouble.

444
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:50,865
- I'll bite.
- I tried to poison my tutor.

445
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:51,900
Did you hate him?

446
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,401
I liked him very much.

447
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:55,337
You just needed to get laid.

448
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,938
Took my analyst two years,

449
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,916
and I don't think they ever
put it that succinctly.

450
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,275
You have everyone convinced

451
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:03,044
you're more complicated
than you actually are.

452
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:05,080
We're all simple souls, I guess.

453
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:06,281
I'm not.

454
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,185
What's this?

455
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:11,785
Sanskrit.

456
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,121
You can read this?

457
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,956
I'm learning.

458
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,962
Read this.

459
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:24,032
Well, in this part,

460
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:26,268
Vishnu reveals his
multi-armed self...

461
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:27,302
No.

462
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,238
Read the words.

463
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:36,777
"And now I am become Death.

464
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:43,952
Destroyer of worlds."

465
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,217
This'll do.

466
00:25:22,357 --> 00:25:23,958
It'll break before dawn.

467
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:27,362
Air cools overnight, just
before dawn, it breaks.

468
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,966
Come.

469
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:41,476
Ah. So, I'm getting married.

470
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:43,111
- Frank. Congratulations!
- Thank you.

471
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:44,946
- Thank you.
- To Jackie?

472
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,349
Yeah, to Jackie.

473
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:48,483
The waitress.

474
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:50,485
Oppie, you're right.
It's lettin' up.

475
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:52,954
I'm gonna go see if
there's any stars.

476
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:55,023
All your talk about
the common man,

477
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:56,567
but Jackie's not good
enough for you, hmm?

478
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,625
Mm-mm.

479
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,160
We join the Party and you can't

480
00:25:59,194 --> 00:26:00,962
- hide your disapproval. Why?
- Oh, now, I...

481
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,073
Is that because that's
supposed to be your thing?

482
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:03,631
I haven't joined
the Party, Frank.

483
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:06,201
And I don't think she should
have convinced you to either.

484
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:07,969
Half of the faculty
is Communist.

485
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,070
Not that half.

486
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:13,141
I'm your brother, Frank, and
I want you to be cautious.

487
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:14,876
And I want to wring your neck.

488
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,181
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

489
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,387
You're happy, I'm happy.

490
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,955
So then I'm happy you're happy

491
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:28,323
that I'm happy.

492
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:34,195
I feel
like I could see

493
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:36,331
one of those dark stars
that you're working on.

494
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:38,933
You can't. That's
the whole point.

495
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:41,302
Their gravity swallows light.

496
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,640
It's like a kind
of hole in space.

497
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:47,008
Is Frank okay?

498
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,444
Yes. He just has
a shitty brother.

499
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,247
It is special here.

500
00:26:54,616 --> 00:26:57,085
When I was a kid,

501
00:26:57,118 --> 00:27:00,155
I thought if I could find a way

502
00:27:00,188 --> 00:27:04,559
to combine physics
and New Mexico,

503
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:07,128
my life would be
perfect.

504
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,464
Little remote for that.

505
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:10,632
Yes.

506
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:12,333
Let's get some sleep.

507
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:14,702
That mesa
we saw today,

508
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:17,238
one of my favorite
places in the world.

509
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,541
And tomorrow we'll climb it.

510
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,009
What's it called?

511
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:24,112
Los Alamos.

512
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:29,217
I didn't expect
to see you today.

513
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:32,220
Do I have to make
an appointment?

514
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:36,291
Hey! Hey,
get back here!

515
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:37,459
Alvarez?

516
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:46,067
Oppie! Oppie!

517
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,102
What? What is it?

518
00:27:48,136 --> 00:27:49,737
They've done it.
They've done it.

519
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,039
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

520
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:53,241
They split the uranium nucleus.

521
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,977
How?

522
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:58,613
Bombard it with neutrons.

523
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,791
It's a
nuclear fission.

524
00:27:59,815 --> 00:28:01,449
They did it, they
split the atom.

525
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:03,051
It's not possible.

526
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,992
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

527
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:19,567
See? Can't be done.

528
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:24,072
Very
elegant. Quite clear.

529
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:26,741
- There's just one problem.
- Where?

530
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,576
Next door.

531
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,545
Alvarez did it.

532
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,714
But then look...

533
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:36,084
these fission pulses,
they're massive.

534
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:39,387
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

535
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,257
Theory will take
you only so far.

536
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:45,760
During the process...

537
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,529
extra neutrons boil off,

538
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:50,732
which could be used to
split other uranium atoms.

539
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:52,166
Chain reaction.

540
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,836
You're thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'.

541
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,638
You, me, and every other
physicist around the world

542
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:58,172
who's seen the news.

543
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:00,675
I'm... what? What
are we all thinking?

544
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:04,479
A bomb, Alvarez.

545
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:07,348
A bomb.

546
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:10,585
I told you, Robert, no
more fucking flowers.

547
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:13,731
I don't understand
what you want from me.

548
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:15,523
I don't want anything from you.

549
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:18,560
Well, you say that
and then you call.

550
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:21,195
Well, don't answer.

551
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,231
I'll always answer.

552
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:29,437
Fine.

553
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,173
Just no more flowers.

554
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:34,576
You're not coming?

555
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:38,546
You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

556
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,584
It's not that simple, Hoke.

557
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:44,786
Chevalier, good
to see you. It's...

558
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,154
Ah, Barbara, good to see you

559
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:48,656
and the illustrious
Dr. Oppenheimer.

560
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,858
I'm Eltenton.

561
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:51,268
- Oh, pleasure.
- Please, please.

562
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,460
Now, might you say a word

563
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:55,229
about organized labor
on campuses, yes?

564
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:56,798
Coming through! Coming through!

565
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:58,409
- F.A.E.C.T.!
- I work at Shell.

566
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:00,444
We've signed up chemists,
we've signed up engineers,

567
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:02,337
so why not scientists
in academia?

568
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,273
Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie!

569
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:08,576
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

570
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,244
Oppie! Oppie!

571
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:13,181
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

572
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:20,321
Teachers are unionized.
Why not professors?

573
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:21,789
Don't you have somewhere to be?

574
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:23,658
Lawrence, academics
have rights too.

575
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:26,194
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

576
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:29,430
- Well, I'll sit in.
- Not this one.

577
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,372
Richard. Dr. Bush.

578
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:39,474
What brings you two up north?

579
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:50,318
Richard, you tell Ruth

580
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,671
I'll be down to
Pasadena Thursday.

581
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:03,264
Your paper
on black holes is in!

582
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:05,266
Oppie!

583
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,937
Where's Hartland? Get
Hartland. Get Hartland.

584
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:11,239
September 1st, 1939,

585
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:13,508
the world's gonna
remember this day.

586
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:15,920
Oh, Hartland. Our
paper, it's in print.

587
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:18,680
You've been upstaged.

588
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:24,820
During the Battle of
Britain, I found myself

589
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:27,588
increasingly out of sympathy
with the

590
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:30,625
policy of neutrality that
Communists advocated.

591
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:34,462
Right after Hitler invaded
Russia and we became allies,

592
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:36,531
these Communist sympathies,
did they return?

593
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:37,598
No.

594
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:42,336
I need to make clear that
my changing views on Russia

595
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,604
did not mean a sharp break

596
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:45,707
from those who held
different views.

597
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,309
For a year or two, and
during a previous marriage,

598
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:51,646
my wife Kitty had been a
Communist Party member.

599
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:55,616
Oop!

600
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,452
This way. This is where
I keep the good stuff.

601
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,487
Well, I thought this
was the Tolmans' house.

602
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,723
I live with them
while I'm at Caltech.

603
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:03,257
Do you two need anything?

604
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,759
We're good, Ruthie.

605
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:08,496
So, you're a biologist.

606
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:11,733
Well, somehow I have
graduated to housewife.

607
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:14,903
Can you explain quantum
mechanics to me?

608
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:15,971
Seems baffling.

609
00:32:16,004 --> 00:32:17,705
Yes, it is.

610
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:21,609
Well, this glass,

611
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:22,543
this drink...

612
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,680
this countertop,

613
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:28,817
uh, our bodies...

614
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:30,752
all of it.

615
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:33,354
It's mostly empty space.

616
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,891
Groupings of tiny energy
waves bound together.

617
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:37,792
By what?

618
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:41,395
Forces of attraction strong
enough to convince us

619
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:43,631
that matter is solid.

620
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:46,801
Stop my body passing
through yours.

621
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,048
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

622
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:01,817
Not very.

623
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:07,555
There is someone that I feel...

624
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:09,024
Does she feel the same way?

625
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:12,895
Sometimes. Not enough.

626
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:17,065
You know, I'm going
to New Mexico.

627
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,901
To my ranch, with friends.

628
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:20,301
You should come.

629
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:22,938
I meant with your husband.

630
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,539
Yes, you did.

631
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:27,475
'Cause you know it won't
make a bit of difference.

632
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:32,948
Why did you marry him?

633
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:36,517
I was lost and he was kind.

634
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:39,554
Lost?

635
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:43,091
Well, my previous
husband had died, and...

636
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,560
at 28, I wasn't really
ready to be a widow.

637
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:47,595
- Who was your first husband?
- Nobody.

638
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:50,098
But my second husband
was Joe Dallet.

639
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:53,101
He was, um, from
money, like me, but...

640
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:56,071
he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

641
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,371
Fell hard.

642
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:58,673
How hard?

643
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,374
Hard enough to spend
the next four years

644
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:01,742
living off beans and pancakes,

645
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:04,545
handing out the <i>Daily
Worker</i> at factory gates.

646
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,082
By 36, I just told Joe I
couldn't take it anymore.

647
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:08,984
Quit the Party and a year later,

648
00:34:09,017 --> 00:34:12,553
I wanted him back, so...
Him, not the <i>Daily Worker.</i>

649
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:14,731
And he said, "Swell, I'll
meet you on my way to Spain."

650
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,457
He went to fight
for the Loyalists?

651
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,593
And then he went to the
brigades and I waited.

652
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,694
And...

653
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:21,930
Joe got himself killed

654
00:34:21,964 --> 00:34:24,365
first time he popped his
head out of the trench.

655
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,136
Ideology got Joe
killed. For nothing.

656
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,038
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

657
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:31,182
My husband offered
both our futures

658
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:32,673
to stop one fascist bullet

659
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:34,877
from embedding
itself in a mudbank.

660
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,612
That's the definition
of nothing.

661
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:39,647
Seems a little reductive.

662
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,415
Pragmatic.

663
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,886
Now here I am.

664
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,722
Wherever the hell this is.

665
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:58,033
I didn't want you to
hear it from anyone else.

666
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:03,805
Least you didn't bring
me flowers.

667
00:35:08,944 --> 00:35:12,513
We both know I'm not
what you want, Jean.

668
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:16,184
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

669
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:17,618
No.

670
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,555
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

671
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,492
You knocked her up, fast work.

672
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:27,162
Can't keep a good man down.

673
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:29,197
I meant her.

674
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,233
She knew what she wanted.

675
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:33,201
What about the husband?

676
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:34,702
We talked, um,

677
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,671
they're getting a divorce, so...

678
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:40,474
we can get married before
she starts showing.

679
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,977
How civilized.

680
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:45,047
You idiot.

681
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,848
This is your community.

682
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:49,818
You think the rules don't
apply to the golden boy?

683
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,620
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

684
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,157
Don't alienate the only
people in the world

685
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,858
that understand what you do.

686
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,962
One day you might need them.

687
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:02,730
F.A.E.C.T. MEMBERS
F.A.E.C.T.!

688
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:03,975
The Federation
of Architects,

689
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:07,135
Engineers, Chemists
and Technicians.

690
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:16,111
Lomanitz, what do
you get paid a month?

691
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:17,288
That's not the point, Lawrence.

692
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:19,613
What do any of
you have in common

693
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,250
with farm laborers
and dock workers?

694
00:36:22,284 --> 00:36:23,852
Plenty.

695
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,456
Everybody out. Now!

696
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:32,693
Not you.

697
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:39,600
What are you doing?

698
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,303
It's a trade union.

699
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,271
Filled with Communists.

700
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,007
So? I haven't joined the Party.

701
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,142
They won't let me bring
you onto the project

702
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,877
because of this shit.

703
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,687
They won't even let me tell
you what the project is.

704
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,148
Oh. I know
what the project is.

705
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:54,249
Oh, really?

706
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:55,583
We've all heard about Einstein

707
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:56,894
and Szilard's
letter to Roosevelt

708
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:58,719
warning him the Germans
could make a bomb,

709
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:01,622
and I know what it means for
the Nazis to have a bomb.

710
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,025
Oh, and I don't?

711
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:05,693
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

712
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:07,795
It's mine.

713
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:10,966
You think that I tell
them about your politics.

714
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:14,635
The next time you're
coming home from a meeting,

715
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:16,704
why don't you take a look
in the rearview mirror?

716
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,807
Listen to the sounds
on your phone line

717
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,910
and stop being so goddamn naive.

718
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:24,745
Why would they care what I do?

719
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:26,747
Because you're
not just self-important,

720
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:28,950
you're actually important.

721
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:31,552
Okay.

722
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:35,190
Okay. I get it.

723
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:37,292
If you could just
be a little more...

724
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,827
Pragmatic.

725
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,971
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others,

726
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:42,097
you don't have to
worry. It's done.

727
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,899
Lawrence.

728
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:50,738
Then welcome to the war.

729
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:53,075
I filled out my
first security questionnaire

730
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:54,376
and was informed

731
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,211
that my involvement
with left-wing groups

732
00:37:56,244 --> 00:38:00,182
would not prove a bar to my
working on the atomic program.

733
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:02,951
<i>Why were
his Communist associations</i>

734
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:06,088
not seen as a security
risk during the war?

735
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,856
Senator, I can't possibly answer

736
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:11,226
for security clearance granted
years before I ever met the man.

737
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,261
Fine. What about after?

738
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:15,230
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer

739
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:19,034
was the most respected
scientific voice in the world.

740
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:21,103
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute,

741
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:24,239
that's why he advised the
Atomic Energy Commission.

742
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:25,340
Simple as that.

743
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:27,976
What are they accusing me of?

744
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,777
I think they just want
to know what happened

745
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:32,314
between 1947 and 1954
to change your mind

746
00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:34,382
on Oppenheimer's
security clearance.

747
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:37,152
I didn't. I was
chair of the AEC,

748
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:40,754
but it wasn't me that brought
the charges against Robert.

749
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:42,033
- Who did?
- Some former staff member

750
00:38:42,057 --> 00:38:43,992
of the Joint
Congressional Committee.

751
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:47,095
He was a rabid
anti-Communist named Borden.

752
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:49,431
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

753
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:52,000
The FBI? Why not go
to the AEC, direct?

754
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:54,735
Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?

755
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:57,205
What did Borden have
against Oppenheimer?

756
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,074
This was the McCarthy Era.

757
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:04,012
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red. And then,

758
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:05,713
<i>reading Oppenheimer's
security file,</i>

759
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:07,916
<i>his Communist brother,
sister-in-law,</i>

760
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:10,018
<i>fiancée, best friend, wife.</i>

761
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:12,387
That's before we even get
to the Chevalier incident.

762
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,158
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

763
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:17,859
Because somebody gave it to him.

764
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:21,695
Somebody who wanted
Robert silenced.

765
00:39:21,729 --> 00:39:23,331
- Who?
- Who knows?

766
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,901
Robert didn't take
care not to upset

767
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:28,170
the power brokers in Washington.

768
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:31,072
His opinions on the
atom became definitive

769
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:34,009
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

770
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:39,848
I came in for plenty
of harsh treatment.

771
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:43,051
There was an AEC vote

772
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:45,053
on the export of
isotopes to Norway,

773
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:48,056
<i>and they drafted in Robert
to make me look like a fool.</i>

774
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:49,790
But,
Dr. Oppenheimer,

775
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:51,927
we've already heard from
Admiral Strauss that

776
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,795
these isotopes could be
useful to our enemies

777
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,140
in the production
of atomic weapons.

778
00:39:56,164 --> 00:39:58,033
Congressmen,
you could use a shovel

779
00:39:58,066 --> 00:39:59,510
in making atomic weapons.

780
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:00,734
In fact, you do.

781
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
You could use a bottle of beer

782
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:03,737
in making atomic weapons.

783
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:05,240
In fact, you do.

784
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:08,210
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components

785
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:11,012
but more useful than a sandwich.

786
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:16,117
<i>Genius is no
guarantee of wisdom.</i>

787
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:19,888
How could this man who
saw so much be so blind?

788
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:30,832
Kitty?

789
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:37,472
Kitty?

790
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:40,909
Kitty, the project...

791
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:44,479
I'm in. I'm in.

792
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:46,281
Let's celebrate.

793
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,521
Shouldn't you go to him?

794
00:40:58,126 --> 00:41:01,296
I have been going to
him all fucking day.

795
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:26,787
Come here, darling.

796
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:29,457
I don't know how to say this.

797
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:32,193
I'm... I'm ashamed to ask.

798
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,162
Anything.

799
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:34,996
Take Peter.

800
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,066
- Sure.
- No, for-for a while, Hoke.

801
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,068
A while.

802
00:41:41,636 --> 00:41:43,438
Does Kitty know you're here?

803
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:45,206
Yes, of course she knows.

804
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:48,076
Of course she knows.

805
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:51,813
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.

806
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:54,316
Forget I asked.

807
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:56,184
Selfish, awful people,

808
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:58,620
they don't know they're
selfish and awful.

809
00:41:58,653 --> 00:42:01,222
Sit, sit, sit.

810
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:06,361
Robert, you see beyond
the world we live in.

811
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:10,632
There is a price to
be paid for that.

812
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:12,233
Of course we'll help you.

813
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:25,347
Everything's
changing, Robert.

814
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,349
Having a child was
always going to change...

815
00:42:27,382 --> 00:42:31,486
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

816
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,922
It's reforming.

817
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,392
This is your moment.

818
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,237
We're putting together a
group to study feasibility...

819
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:43,064
"We" shouldn't be doing
anything. You should.

820
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:46,101
Lawrence won't get this done.

821
00:42:46,134 --> 00:42:48,269
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

822
00:42:57,112 --> 00:42:59,247
Who are the uniforms?

823
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:01,950
I thought you might know.

824
00:43:02,984 --> 00:43:05,253
Dr. Oppenheimer.

825
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:07,255
I'm Colonel Groves.

826
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,524
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

827
00:43:09,557 --> 00:43:11,059
Have that dry-cleaned.

828
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:19,033
Well, if that's how you
treat Lieutenant Colonel,

829
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:22,437
I'd hate to see how you
treat a humble physicist.

830
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,539
Ah, if I ever meet
one, I'll let you know.

831
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,074
Ouch.

832
00:43:26,107 --> 00:43:27,675
Theaters of combat
all over the world,

833
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:29,644
but I have to stay
in Washington.

834
00:43:29,677 --> 00:43:32,380
- Why?
- I built the Pentagon.

835
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:35,049
The brass likes it so much
they made me take over

836
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,218
the Manhattan Engineer District.

837
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:38,386
Which is?

838
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,689
Oh, don't be a smart ass. You
know damn well what it is.

839
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:43,425
You and half of every
physics department

840
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:46,294
across the country.
That's problem number one.

841
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:48,062
I thought problem
number one would be

842
00:43:48,096 --> 00:43:49,364
securing enough uranium ore.

843
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:52,500
1,200 tons bought the
day I took charge.

844
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:53,701
Processing?

845
00:43:53,735 --> 00:43:55,937
Just broke ground at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

846
00:43:56,738 --> 00:43:58,440
Now I'm looking for
a project director.

847
00:43:58,473 --> 00:44:00,575
And my name came up?

848
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:01,676
Nope.

849
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:05,046
Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

850
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,448
Which made me curious.

851
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:08,349
What have you found out?

852
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,753
You're a dilettante,
a womanizer,

853
00:44:11,786 --> 00:44:13,121
a suspected Communist...

854
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:14,556
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

855
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:16,191
I said "suspected."

856
00:44:16,224 --> 00:44:20,462
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

857
00:44:20,495 --> 00:44:21,529
Nothing good, no?

858
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:23,231
Not even "he's
brilliant, but..."

859
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:25,066
Well, brilliance is
taken for granted

860
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,601
in your circle, so no.

861
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:28,603
No, the only person who
had anything good to say

862
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:30,371
was Richard Tolman.

863
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:32,507
Tolman thinks you
have integrity,

864
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,676
but he also strikes me as a guy

865
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,078
who knows more about
science than people.

866
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:41,082
Yet here you are. You
don't take much on trust.

867
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:43,117
I don't take anything on trust.

868
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:48,423
Why don't you have
a Nobel Prize?

869
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:49,524
Why aren't you a general?

870
00:44:49,557 --> 00:44:50,734
They're making me one for this.

871
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:52,126
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

872
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,761
A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

873
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:56,130
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

874
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:00,201
So how would you proceed?

875
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:04,405
You're talking
about turning theory

876
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:06,608
into a practical weapons system

877
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:07,775
faster than the Nazis.

878
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,544
Who have a 12-month head start.

879
00:45:09,577 --> 00:45:10,712
Eighteen.

880
00:45:10,745 --> 00:45:12,113
How could you
possibly know that?

881
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:14,182
Our fast neutron
research took six months.

882
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:15,726
The man they've
undoubtedly put in charge

883
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,151
will have made that
leap instantly.

884
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:18,395
Who do you think
they put in charge?

885
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:19,521
Werner Heisenberg.

886
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:22,123
He has the most
intuitive understanding

887
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:23,826
of atomic structure
I have ever seen.

888
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,560
- You know his work?
- I know him.

889
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:27,438
<i>Just like I know Walther
Bothe, von Weizsäcker, Diebner.</i>

890
00:45:27,462 --> 00:45:30,265
In a straight race,
the Germans win.

891
00:45:30,298 --> 00:45:33,034
- We've got one hope.
- Which is?

892
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:35,270
Anti-Semitism.

893
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:37,405
What?

894
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:40,275
Hitler called quantum
physics "Jewish science."

895
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:42,143
Said it right to
Einstein's face.

896
00:45:42,176 --> 00:45:45,413
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so... so blinded by hate

897
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:47,248
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

898
00:45:47,282 --> 00:45:49,217
because it'll take
vast resources.

899
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,795
Our nation's best
scientists working together.

900
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:52,220
Right now, they're scattered.

901
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:53,856
Which gives us
compartmentalization.

902
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:55,757
All minds have to
see the whole task

903
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,158
to contribute efficiently.

904
00:45:57,191 --> 00:45:59,427
Poor security may
cost us the race.

905
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,296
Inefficiency will.

906
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:03,164
The Germans know
more than us anyway.

907
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,300
The Russians don't.

908
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:09,270
Remind me, who are
we at war with?

909
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:11,739
Somebody with your past
doesn't want to be seen

910
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:13,374
downplaying the importance

911
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:16,144
of security from our
Communist allies.

912
00:46:16,177 --> 00:46:18,847
Point taken. But, no.

913
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:21,182
You don't
get to say "no" to me.

914
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:23,484
It's my job to say "no"
to you when you're wrong.

915
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:25,520
So you have the job now?

916
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:27,622
Uh, I'm considering it.

917
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:32,660
I'm starting to see where
you got your reputation.

918
00:46:33,862 --> 00:46:36,297
My favorite response,

919
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:38,666
"Oppenheimer couldn't
run a hamburger stand."

920
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:41,635
I couldn't.

921
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:45,640
But I can run the
Manhattan Project.

922
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:48,676
There's a way to
balance these things.

923
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,915
Keep the Rad Lab here at
Berkeley under Lawrence.

924
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:55,216
Met Lab in Chicago,
under Szilard.

925
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:57,685
Large-scale refining, where
did you say? Tennessee.

926
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,387
- And Hanford.
- And Hanford.

927
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,491
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

928
00:47:03,524 --> 00:47:04,893
connected by rail.

929
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:06,594
Focused on one goal.

930
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:09,330
One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.

931
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:11,666
<i>A secret laboratory. In
the middle of nowhere,</i>

932
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,167
<i>secure, self-sufficient,</i>

933
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:14,569
equipment, housing, the works.

934
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:16,771
Keep everyone there
until it's done.

935
00:47:16,805 --> 00:47:18,841
It'll need a school,
stores, a church.

936
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:20,308
Why?

937
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:21,652
<i>If we don't
let scientists</i>

938
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,387
bring their families,
we'll never get the best.

939
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:25,480
You want security, build
a town, build it fast.

940
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:26,581
Where?

941
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,553
Welcome to Los Alamos.

942
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:35,390
Now, there's a boys school
we'll have to commandeer,

943
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,401
and the local Indians come
up here for burial rites.

944
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:40,662
But, apart from that, nothing.
Forty miles. Any direction.

945
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:42,630
Enough to find the perfect spot.

946
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:45,166
- For?
- Success.

947
00:47:50,438 --> 00:47:52,440
Build him a town. Fast.

948
00:47:53,474 --> 00:47:55,978
Let's go recruit
some scientists.

949
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:58,346
Why would I leave my family?

950
00:47:58,379 --> 00:47:59,824
I told you, you can
bring your family.

951
00:47:59,848 --> 00:48:01,282
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

952
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:03,418
A soldier? He's a general.

953
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:05,286
I've got all the soldier I need.

954
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:06,889
What can I tell them?

955
00:48:06,922 --> 00:48:09,257
Heisenberg, Diebner,
Bothe and Bohr.

956
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,591
What do these men
have in common?

957
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,627
The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

958
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,996
- Yes, and?
- Uh...

959
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:17,298
As much as you like,

960
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:19,467
until you feel my
boot on your balls.

961
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,270
You know isotopes and
you know explosives

962
00:48:22,303 --> 00:48:23,604
better than anyone in the world.

963
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:26,240
But you can't tell
us what you're doing?

964
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,546
- I don't know.
- The Nazis have them.

965
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,715
- Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
- Under Nazi occupation.

966
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:35,616
Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

967
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,986
Why would we go to
the middle of nowhere

968
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,487
for who knows how
long?

969
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,622
For a year or two. Or three.

970
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:46,227
Uh, General, could
you give us a moment?

971
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:50,364
It's about unleashing
the strong force...

972
00:48:51,499 --> 00:48:52,901
before the Nazis do.

973
00:48:52,935 --> 00:48:54,870
Oh, my God.

974
00:48:54,903 --> 00:48:56,014
Niels won't work for the Nazis.

975
00:48:56,038 --> 00:48:57,338
No, never.

976
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:59,674
But while they
have him, we don't.

977
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:00,876
That's why I need you.

978
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,878
Why would you think I'd do that?

979
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:04,746
"Why?" "Why?"

980
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:06,991
How about because this is the
most important fucking thing

981
00:49:07,015 --> 00:49:09,017
to ever happen in the
history of the world.

982
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:10,485
How about that?

983
00:49:11,053 --> 00:49:12,487
Fuck.

984
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:19,794
They are not gonna let
me onto this project.

985
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:21,897
And failing a security
check is not gonna be good

986
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,598
for a career, even
after the war.

987
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:26,400
So you're a fellow
traveler. So what?

988
00:49:26,434 --> 00:49:27,802
This is a national emergency.

989
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:31,006
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

990
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,340
They need us.

991
00:49:32,373 --> 00:49:34,542
Until they don't.

992
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:40,015
Is there any chance of
getting Bohr out of Denmark?

993
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:43,051
Nah, no dice. I checked
with the British.

994
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:45,386
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

995
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:46,822
there's just no way.

996
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:49,791
Is he that important?

997
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:52,861
How many people do you know
who proved Einstein wrong?

998
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:56,031
You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

999
00:49:56,064 --> 00:49:57,799
No, plane's too risky.

1000
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,301
Country needs us.

1001
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,771
The Harvard guys,

1002
00:50:03,806 --> 00:50:06,374
they say the building's too
small for the cyclotron.

1003
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:10,511
Get them together
with the architects.

1004
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,716
When's this place
supposed to open?

1005
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:19,821
Two months.

1006
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:23,025
Robert, you're the
great improviser,

1007
00:50:23,058 --> 00:50:25,093
but this...

1008
00:50:25,127 --> 00:50:26,727
you can't do in your head.

1009
00:50:27,762 --> 00:50:29,363
Four divisions.

1010
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:34,102
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

1011
00:50:34,136 --> 00:50:35,103
Who's running Theoretical?

1012
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:36,537
I am.

1013
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:37,782
That's what
I was afraid of.

1014
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:39,674
You're spread too thin.

1015
00:50:40,876 --> 00:50:42,577
So you take Theoretical.

1016
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:48,382
I'm not coming here, Robert.

1017
00:50:54,022 --> 00:50:55,690
Why not?

1018
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:05,633
You drop a bomb and it falls
on the just and the unjust.

1019
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:09,537
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

1020
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,974
to be a weapon of
mass destruction.

1021
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:22,516
Izzy.

1022
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:27,788
I don't know if we can be
trusted with such a weapon.

1023
00:51:29,157 --> 00:51:32,460
But I know the Nazis can't.

1024
00:51:35,864 --> 00:51:38,666
We have no choice.

1025
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:41,502
Then...

1026
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:45,207
the second thing you'll
have to do is appoint

1027
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,508
Hans Bethe to run the
Theoretical division.

1028
00:51:49,878 --> 00:51:51,712
Wait, what was the first?

1029
00:51:51,746 --> 00:51:54,216
Take off that
ridiculous uniform.

1030
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:55,449
You're a scientist.

1031
00:51:55,483 --> 00:51:57,085
Groves is insisting we join.

1032
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,553
Tell Groves to go
shit in his hat.

1033
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:03,058
They need us for who
we are. So be yourself.

1034
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:05,060
Only better.

1035
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,134
This is the only key.

1036
00:52:46,168 --> 00:52:47,601
And Teller's already here.

1037
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:49,503
Shall I just show him in?

1038
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:51,206
No, let's wait for the others.

1039
00:52:59,147 --> 00:53:00,148
Let's get started.

1040
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:02,250
Hello, Edward.

1041
00:53:02,284 --> 00:53:03,986
Yes.

1042
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:05,720
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

1043
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:08,756
until the T-section at
Los Alamos is finished.

1044
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:11,093
- Edward, can I please...
- It is more important.

1045
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:15,130
When I calculated
the chain reaction,

1046
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:17,866
I found a rather
troubling possibility.

1047
00:53:17,899 --> 00:53:20,002
No.

1048
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:21,269
But this can't be right.

1049
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:23,238
Show me how you did
your calculations.

1050
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:24,672
Yes.

1051
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,244
It's exponential.

1052
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:31,746
No. No, no, no. No.

1053
00:53:34,282 --> 00:53:36,284
This is fantasy.

1054
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:38,586
Teller's calculations
can't be right.

1055
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:41,289
Do them yourself while
I go to Princeton.

1056
00:53:41,323 --> 00:53:43,158
- What for?
- To talk to Einstein.

1057
00:53:43,191 --> 00:53:45,760
Well, there's not much common
ground between you two.

1058
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:48,830
That's why I should
get his view.

1059
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:54,269
- Albert.
- Hmm?

1060
00:53:54,302 --> 00:53:57,205
Ah. Dr. Oppenheimer.

1061
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,706
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?

1062
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,308
We walk here most days.

1063
00:54:00,342 --> 00:54:05,147
Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

1064
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,647
Albert, might I have a word?

1065
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,085
Of course. 'Scuse me, Kurt.

1066
00:54:11,086 --> 00:54:14,022
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

1067
00:54:14,056 --> 00:54:15,656
Even in Princeton.

1068
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:18,793
He's convinced that the
Nazis can poison his food.

1069
00:54:18,827 --> 00:54:20,095
Mm.

1070
00:54:20,128 --> 00:54:21,963
Hmm? Huh.

1071
00:54:23,832 --> 00:54:25,666
Wha...

1072
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:33,041
Whose... Whose work is this?

1073
00:54:33,075 --> 00:54:34,109
Teller's.

1074
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:37,711
What do you take it to mean?

1075
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:39,680
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

1076
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:43,751
releasing neutrons to
smash into other nuclei.

1077
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:45,987
Criticality, a
point of no return,

1078
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:47,621
massive explosive force.

1079
00:54:47,655 --> 00:54:49,991
But this time, the chain
reaction doesn't stop.

1080
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:53,862
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1081
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,898
When we detonate
an atomic device,

1082
00:54:56,932 --> 00:54:59,101
we might start a
chain reaction that...

1083
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:01,602
destroys the world.

1084
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,672
So here we are, hmm?

1085
00:55:04,705 --> 00:55:09,010
Lost in your quantum
world of probabilities

1086
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:10,778
and needing certainty.

1087
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:13,681
Can you run the
calculations yourself?

1088
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:15,117
About the only thing

1089
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,420
you and I have in common is
a disdain for mathematics.

1090
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:21,022
Who's working on
this in-in Berkeley?

1091
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:22,357
Hans Bethe.

1092
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,226
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1093
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:28,729
And if the truth
is catastrophic?

1094
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:30,065
Then you stop.

1095
00:55:30,098 --> 00:55:33,835
And you share your
findings with the Nazis.

1096
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:37,005
So neither side
destroys the world.

1097
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,243
Robert.

1098
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,914
This is yours, not mine.

1099
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,195
Teller's wrong.

1100
00:56:00,228 --> 00:56:01,429
He's wrong.

1101
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,808
When you know Teller's
critical assumptions,

1102
00:56:13,842 --> 00:56:15,177
the real picture emerges.

1103
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,012
Bottom line?

1104
00:56:17,045 --> 00:56:19,147
The chances of an
uncontrolled nuclear reaction

1105
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:20,182
are near zero.

1106
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:22,851
Near zero.

1107
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:25,153
- Oppie, this is good news.
- Mm.

1108
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:27,721
Can you run them again?

1109
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,491
No, you'll get the same answer.

1110
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:31,102
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

1111
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:33,962
the best assurance you're
going to get is this.

1112
00:56:33,995 --> 00:56:35,063
Near zero.

1113
00:56:37,265 --> 00:56:39,935
Theory
will take you only so far.

1114
00:56:39,968 --> 00:56:41,469
- Mm.
<i>- Hello!</i>

1115
00:56:41,503 --> 00:56:42,813
- Hello, you.
- Hi.

1116
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:44,172
We missed him.

1117
00:56:44,206 --> 00:56:45,340
You want to adopt?

1118
00:56:45,373 --> 00:56:46,774
She's kidding.

1119
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,742
We wanted to see
you before we left.

1120
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:51,947
For parts unknown.

1121
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,516
You know who
I ran into the other day?

1122
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:56,184
Eltenton.

1123
00:56:56,218 --> 00:56:57,485
Oh.

1124
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:59,221
The chemist from
Shell? The union guy?

1125
00:56:59,254 --> 00:57:03,124
Yeah. He...
The, uh, F.A.E.C.T. guy.

1126
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:06,528
He was moaning about how
we're handling the war.

1127
00:57:06,561 --> 00:57:08,762
How so?

1128
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:11,533
Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

1129
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:13,902
Apparently our
government's not sharing

1130
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:16,037
any research with the Russians.

1131
00:57:16,071 --> 00:57:17,038
Well, he said,

1132
00:57:17,072 --> 00:57:19,808
"Most scientists think
the policy is stupid."

1133
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:24,980
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1134
00:57:25,013 --> 00:57:27,382
He mentioned that if anyone

1135
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:30,385
had anything they
wanted to pass on,

1136
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:32,254
uh, going around
official channels,

1137
00:57:32,287 --> 00:57:34,222
that he could help.

1138
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:44,532
That would be treason.

1139
00:57:44,566 --> 00:57:47,402
Yes, of course.

1140
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:49,237
I just thought you should know.

1141
00:57:52,374 --> 00:57:53,842
The brat is down.

1142
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:55,243
Where are the martinis?

1143
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:01,950
Coming right up.

1144
00:58:01,983 --> 00:58:03,451
<i>Conversation ended there.</i>

1145
00:58:03,485 --> 00:58:05,587
Nothing in our
long-standing friendship

1146
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,188
would have led me to believe

1147
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:09,958
that Chevalier was actually
seeking information,

1148
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:12,460
and I am certain
that he had no idea

1149
00:58:12,494 --> 00:58:14,795
of the work in
which I was engaged.

1150
00:58:19,334 --> 00:58:21,303
It has long been clear to me

1151
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:24,039
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

1152
00:58:24,072 --> 00:58:25,583
<i>The
Oppenheimer situation</i>

1153
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:28,510
<i>highlights the tension
between scientists</i>

1154
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:30,145
and the security apparatus.

1155
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:32,047
In hopes of learning
how the nominee handled

1156
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,416
such issues during
his time at the AEC,

1157
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:37,952
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

1158
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,188
Who are they bringing in?

1159
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:41,189
They hadn't said.

1160
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:42,590
Mr. Chairman,
if I may,

1161
00:58:42,624 --> 00:58:45,160
I'm nominated for
Commerce Secretary.

1162
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:47,495
Why seek the opinion
of scientists?

1163
00:58:47,529 --> 00:58:49,864
This is a Cabinet post, Admiral.

1164
00:58:49,898 --> 00:58:52,067
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1165
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,903
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying.

1166
00:58:54,936 --> 00:58:56,438
I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

1167
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:58,606
This is not a court.

1168
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,042
Formality, huh?

1169
00:59:01,076 --> 00:59:02,353
No
presidential Cabinet nominee

1170
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:04,946
has failed to be
confirmed since 1925.

1171
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:07,082
This is just how
the game is played.

1172
00:59:07,115 --> 00:59:08,416
It's in the bag, Lewis.

1173
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,651
So play nice.

1174
00:59:09,684 --> 00:59:11,953
<i>They bring in a
scientist, so what?</i>

1175
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:13,988
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

1176
00:59:14,022 --> 00:59:16,057
They resent anyone who
questions their judgment,

1177
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:18,093
<i>especially if you're
not one of them.</i>

1178
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:19,427
I was chair of the AEC.

1179
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:21,896
I'm easy to blame for
what happened to Robert.

1180
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,231
We can't have the
Senate thinking

1181
00:59:23,264 --> 00:59:26,368
the scientific community
doesn't support you, sir.

1182
00:59:26,401 --> 00:59:28,236
Or should we pivot?

1183
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:30,238
- To what?
- And embrace it.

1184
00:59:30,271 --> 00:59:33,041
"I fought Oppenheimer,
and the US won."

1185
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:34,642
I-I don't think we
need to go there.

1186
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:36,954
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

1187
00:59:36,978 --> 00:59:38,418
- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

1188
00:59:38,446 --> 00:59:40,524
Can you get the name of the
scientist they've called?

1189
00:59:40,548 --> 00:59:42,117
- Probably.
- Find out if he was

1190
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,519
based in Chicago or Los
Alamos during the war.

1191
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:45,920
Why does that matter?

1192
00:59:45,954 --> 00:59:47,164
Well, if he was
based in Chicago,

1193
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:48,599
then he worked under
Szilard and Fermi,

1194
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:50,925
not the cult of
Oppie at Los Alamos.

1195
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:52,193
Robert built that damn place.

1196
00:59:52,227 --> 00:59:54,996
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,

1197
00:59:55,029 --> 00:59:56,431
all rolled into one.

1198
01:00:09,377 --> 01:00:11,179
All it needs is a saloon.

1199
01:00:39,607 --> 01:00:42,177
There's no kitchen.

1200
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:46,147
Really? We'll fix that.

1201
01:00:52,053 --> 01:00:55,457
Barbed wire, guns.

1202
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,591
Oppie.

1203
01:00:56,624 --> 01:00:58,259
We're at war, Hans.

1204
01:01:00,662 --> 01:01:03,231
Halifax. 1917.

1205
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:06,234
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

1206
01:01:08,636 --> 01:01:11,573
A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

1207
01:01:15,243 --> 01:01:18,079
The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

1208
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:20,081
Now let's calculate how
much more destructive

1209
01:01:20,114 --> 01:01:22,784
it would have been
if it were a nuclear

1210
01:01:22,818 --> 01:01:24,486
and not a chemical reaction.

1211
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:28,156
Expressing power in
terms of tons of TNT.

1212
01:01:28,189 --> 01:01:29,691
But it will be thousands.

1213
01:01:29,724 --> 01:01:33,161
Well, then kilotons.

1214
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:40,101
Using U-235,

1215
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:42,704
- the bomb will need a...
- Uh-uh.

1216
01:01:42,737 --> 01:01:45,808
Sorry. Gadget will
need a 33-pound sphere

1217
01:01:45,841 --> 01:01:47,308
about this size.

1218
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:51,145
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

1219
01:01:52,547 --> 01:01:53,781
Here's the amount of uranium

1220
01:01:53,816 --> 01:01:57,151
Oak Ridge refined
all of last month.

1221
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:03,558
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

1222
01:02:04,692 --> 01:02:07,795
Now, if we can
enrich these amounts,

1223
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,632
we need a way to detonate them.

1224
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:12,767
Are we boring you, Edward?

1225
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,402
A little bit, yes.

1226
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:15,670
May I ask why?

1227
01:02:15,703 --> 01:02:17,138
We all
entered this room

1228
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:19,107
knowing a fission
bomb was possible.

1229
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,743
How 'bout we leave it
with something new?

1230
01:02:21,776 --> 01:02:22,777
Such as?

1231
01:02:22,811 --> 01:02:25,547
Instead of uranium or plutonium,

1232
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,581
we use hydrogen.

1233
01:02:28,149 --> 01:02:29,760
- Heavy hydrogen.
- Hydrogen.

1234
01:02:29,784 --> 01:02:32,554
Deuterium. You see?

1235
01:02:32,587 --> 01:02:34,289
We compact the atoms together

1236
01:02:34,322 --> 01:02:37,392
under great pressure to
induce a fusion reaction.

1237
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:41,162
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1238
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:42,263
but megatons.

1239
01:02:42,297 --> 01:02:43,231
A big
fission reaction...

1240
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:44,833
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1241
01:02:44,867 --> 01:02:49,571
So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1242
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:51,673
A small fission bomb.

1243
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:53,408
There we are.

1244
01:02:55,343 --> 01:02:57,145
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

1245
01:02:57,178 --> 01:02:59,147
can we get back to
the business at hand?

1246
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,524
The isotopes issue

1247
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:04,185
wasn't your most important
policy disagreement

1248
01:03:04,218 --> 01:03:05,854
with Dr. Oppenheimer.

1249
01:03:05,888 --> 01:03:08,289
It was the hydrogen
bomb, wasn't it?

1250
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:11,192
Uh, as colleagues,
we agreed to disagree

1251
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:13,227
on a great many things, uh,

1252
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:14,495
and, well, one of them

1253
01:03:14,529 --> 01:03:17,599
was the need for an
H-bomb program, yes.

1254
01:03:30,445 --> 01:03:33,214
Thanks for convening
on short notice.

1255
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:34,716
I can't believe it.

1256
01:03:35,717 --> 01:03:37,251
Well, here we are.

1257
01:03:37,285 --> 01:03:39,287
Catch me up. What do we know?

1258
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,824
One of our B-29s over
the North Pacific

1259
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:43,358
has detected radiation.

1260
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:45,159
Do we have the filter papers?

1261
01:03:45,193 --> 01:03:47,195
There's no doubt what this is.

1262
01:03:47,228 --> 01:03:48,439
White House says
there's a doubt.

1263
01:03:48,463 --> 01:03:49,898
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1264
01:03:49,932 --> 01:03:52,634
Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

1265
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:55,637
It's an atomic test.

1266
01:03:58,272 --> 01:03:59,674
The Russians have a bomb.

1267
01:03:59,707 --> 01:04:03,444
We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some...

1268
01:04:03,478 --> 01:04:05,780
What were you guys
doing at Los Alamos?

1269
01:04:05,814 --> 01:04:06,949
Wasn't security tight?

1270
01:04:06,982 --> 01:04:08,483
Of course it was.
You weren't there.

1271
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:10,919
- It was...
- Forgive me, Doctor...

1272
01:04:10,953 --> 01:04:13,388
but I was there.

1273
01:04:14,455 --> 01:04:15,790
We can now consider

1274
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:17,759
the actual mechanics
of detonation.

1275
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:18,927
Any ideas?

1276
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:20,695
I call
this "shooting."

1277
01:04:20,728 --> 01:04:24,265
We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

1278
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:26,801
with enough force to
achieve criticality.

1279
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:28,503
What do we think? Anyone?

1280
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:30,338
I've been
thinking about implosion.

1281
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:32,340
Explosives around the
sphere blast inwards,

1282
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:34,409
crushing the material.

1283
01:04:34,442 --> 01:04:36,377
I'd like to
investigate that idea.

1284
01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:38,713
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

1285
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:40,816
Progress?

1286
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:42,684
Nice to see you too.

1287
01:04:42,717 --> 01:04:44,485
Meet the British contingent.

1288
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,354
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1289
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:48,256
How long have you been British?

1290
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:49,500
Since Hitler told
me I wasn't German.

1291
01:04:49,524 --> 01:04:53,327
Uh-huh. Come, welcome
to Los Alamos.

1292
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,229
School's up and running.

1293
01:04:55,263 --> 01:04:57,565
Bar. Always running.

1294
01:04:57,598 --> 01:05:00,601
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

1295
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:03,571
- Is that...
- Mrs. Serber, yes.

1296
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:05,007
I've offered jobs
to all the wives.

1297
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,507
Admin, librarians, computation.

1298
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,844
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

1299
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:11,446
- Are these women qualified?
- Don't be absurd.

1300
01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:13,849
These are some of the brightest
minds in our community.

1301
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:15,450
And they're already
security cleared.

1302
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:17,361
I've informed General
Groves you've been holding

1303
01:05:17,385 --> 01:05:18,854
cross-divisional
open discussions

1304
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:20,588
- on a nightly basis.
- Shut them down.

1305
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:22,958
Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security...

1306
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:24,492
It's only the top men.

1307
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:26,360
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

1308
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:27,595
These men aren't stupid.

1309
01:05:27,628 --> 01:05:29,464
- They can be discreet.
- I don't like it.

1310
01:05:29,497 --> 01:05:32,400
You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

1311
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,475
Once a week. Top men only.

1312
01:05:40,508 --> 01:05:41,877
I'd like to bring
my brother here.

1313
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,377
No.

1314
01:05:44,012 --> 01:05:45,780
Uh, Nichols...

1315
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:48,851
I still haven't heard
that my security clearance

1316
01:05:48,884 --> 01:05:50,451
- has been approved.
- It hasn't.

1317
01:05:50,485 --> 01:05:51,854
We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1318
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:52,921
No, you should wait.

1319
01:05:54,123 --> 01:05:55,232
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start.

1320
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:58,326
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

1321
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:00,361
is proving difficult to
obtain is not my fault.

1322
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:01,662
It's yours.

1323
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:03,631
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

1324
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:04,665
Because I'm going.

1325
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:08,469
And how many
people were in these, uh,

1326
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:10,705
- open discussions?
- Too many.

1327
01:06:10,738 --> 01:06:12,083
Compartmentalization was
supposed to be the protocol.

1328
01:06:12,107 --> 01:06:14,042
We were in a race
against the Nazis.

1329
01:06:14,076 --> 01:06:16,511
And now the race is
against the Soviets.

1330
01:06:16,544 --> 01:06:18,056
- Not unless we start it.
- Robert.

1331
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,482
They just fired a starting gun.

1332
01:06:21,516 --> 01:06:23,484
What's the nature of the
device they detonated?

1333
01:06:23,518 --> 01:06:25,063
The data
indicates it may have been

1334
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:27,388
a plutonium implosion device.

1335
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:30,525
Like the one you
built at Los Alamos.

1336
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:32,393
The Russians have a bomb,

1337
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:33,704
Truman needs to
know what's next.

1338
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,530
What's next? Arms talks.

1339
01:06:35,563 --> 01:06:37,431
- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

1340
01:06:38,366 --> 01:06:39,567
What about the Super?

1341
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,335
Does Truman even know about it?

1342
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:43,371
Did we brief him on that?

1343
01:06:43,404 --> 01:06:44,472
Not specifically.

1344
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:45,808
We still don't know

1345
01:06:45,841 --> 01:06:47,608
if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

1346
01:06:47,642 --> 01:06:49,553
Right, my understanding is
that Teller proposed it?

1347
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:51,412
- Yes.
- At Los Alamos?

1348
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:53,091
Teller's designs have always
been wildly impractical.

1349
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:55,449
You'd have to
deliver by ox cart.

1350
01:06:55,483 --> 01:06:56,760
- Not airplane.
- Oppie.

1351
01:06:56,784 --> 01:07:00,488
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,
you want to comment?

1352
01:07:01,722 --> 01:07:02,825
No.

1353
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:06,962
Because if it can
put us ahead again,

1354
01:07:06,995 --> 01:07:10,032
the President of
the United States

1355
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:12,067
needs to know about it.

1356
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:15,403
And if the Russians
know about it already,

1357
01:07:15,436 --> 01:07:18,439
from a spy at Los Alamos,

1358
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:19,774
then we've gotta get going.

1359
01:07:19,808 --> 01:07:22,777
There's no proof there
was a spy at Los Alamos.

1360
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:23,879
Robert.

1361
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:30,484
They put it under
the football stadium?

1362
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:32,453
The field's not in use anymore.

1363
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:34,722
Just as well.

1364
01:07:36,024 --> 01:07:38,459
- Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

1365
01:07:41,163 --> 01:07:42,496
I hear you got a little town.

1366
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,764
Yes. Come and see.

1367
01:07:45,499 --> 01:07:49,604
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

1368
01:07:49,637 --> 01:07:51,572
Everybody will go crazy.

1369
01:07:51,606 --> 01:07:55,476
Thank you for the vote
of confidence, Szilard.

1370
01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:59,147
Do we really... do we really
need that in the notes?

1371
01:07:59,181 --> 01:08:01,616
When are you going
to try it out?

1372
01:08:01,649 --> 01:08:02,683
We did.

1373
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:07,089
The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1374
01:08:07,122 --> 01:08:08,756
Didn't Groves tell you?

1375
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:10,424
No.

1376
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:18,033
One at a time,
please, one at a time.

1377
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:19,533
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1378
01:08:20,635 --> 01:08:23,105
I tried Personnel. They
asked if I could type.

1379
01:08:23,138 --> 01:08:24,438
Can you?

1380
01:08:24,472 --> 01:08:25,606
Harvard forgot to teach that

1381
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,475
on the graduate
chemistry course.

1382
01:08:28,844 --> 01:08:31,746
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig
here on the plutonium team.

1383
01:08:37,518 --> 01:08:39,187
What the hell were
you doing in Chicago?

1384
01:08:39,221 --> 01:08:40,688
Visiting the Met?

1385
01:08:40,721 --> 01:08:41,732
- Why? Why?
- Well, you can't talk to...

1386
01:08:41,756 --> 01:08:43,791
Because we have every right...

1387
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:46,161
You have just the
rights that I give you.

1388
01:08:46,194 --> 01:08:47,662
No more, no less.

1389
01:08:47,695 --> 01:08:50,132
We are adults trying
to run a project here.

1390
01:08:50,165 --> 01:08:51,867
This is ridiculous.

1391
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,668
Tell him.

1392
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:56,838
Compartmentalization is
the protocol we agreed to.

1393
01:08:57,973 --> 01:08:59,207
Enough of this madhouse.

1394
01:08:59,241 --> 01:09:01,609
Nobody can work under
these conditions.

1395
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:06,081
You know what,
Generalissimo? I quit.

1396
01:09:06,114 --> 01:09:07,515
Thanks for nothing.

1397
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:11,119
Better
off without him.

1398
01:09:12,553 --> 01:09:13,587
Aren't you more concerned

1399
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:15,991
about his discretion out there?

1400
01:09:16,024 --> 01:09:18,427
We'll have him killed.

1401
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:21,830
I was just kidding.

1402
01:09:21,863 --> 01:09:24,799
- No, he hates me, not America.
- You know, General,

1403
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,169
not everyone has levers
to pull like mine.

1404
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:29,037
I don't think I understand.

1405
01:09:29,071 --> 01:09:31,239
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past.

1406
01:09:31,273 --> 01:09:33,008
You hired me because of it.

1407
01:09:34,009 --> 01:09:35,978
So you could control me.

1408
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:38,612
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1409
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:40,681
I'm just a humble soldier.

1410
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:42,226
You're neither humble
nor just a soldier.

1411
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,261
You studied engineering at MIT.

1412
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:45,120
Guilty as charged.

1413
01:09:45,153 --> 01:09:46,654
Well, now we
understand each other,

1414
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:48,132
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

1415
01:09:48,156 --> 01:09:50,959
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

1416
01:09:55,864 --> 01:09:57,607
<i>General
Groves, were you aware</i>

1417
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,935
<i>of Dr. Oppenheimer's
left-wing associations</i>

1418
01:09:59,968 --> 01:10:01,635
<i>when you appointed him?</i>

1419
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:03,314
I was aware that there
were suspicions about him.

1420
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:05,207
I was aware he
had a very extreme

1421
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,607
liberal background.

1422
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,252
In your opinion, would
he ever consciously

1423
01:10:08,276 --> 01:10:09,577
commit a disloyal act?

1424
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,213
I would be amazed if he did.

1425
01:10:11,246 --> 01:10:14,316
So you had complete
confidence in his integrity.

1426
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:15,750
At Los Alamos, yes,

1427
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:17,119
which is where I
really knew him.

1428
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:19,121
General, did your
security officers

1429
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:20,621
on the project advise you

1430
01:10:20,654 --> 01:10:22,133
against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1431
01:10:22,157 --> 01:10:25,961
They could not and would not
clear him until I insisted.

1432
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:28,629
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

1433
01:10:28,662 --> 01:10:29,907
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
security file.

1434
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:31,599
I did.

1435
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:32,810
Well, then there's only
really one question

1436
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:34,302
I need answered here today.

1437
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:36,038
In light of the
current AEC guidelines,

1438
01:10:36,071 --> 01:10:38,773
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1439
01:10:38,807 --> 01:10:40,876
Do you have the guidelines?

1440
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:50,618
Under current
AEC guidelines,

1441
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:52,686
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1442
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:08,702
Physics and New
Mexico, huh?

1443
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:11,772
My God. What a trek.

1444
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:13,275
That's why you need a liaison.

1445
01:11:13,308 --> 01:11:14,843
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1446
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:17,079
You're gonna be okay.

1447
01:11:17,112 --> 01:11:18,280
This way, gentlemen.

1448
01:11:28,256 --> 01:11:30,092
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

1449
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:32,693
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1450
01:11:32,726 --> 01:11:35,063
Compartmentalization. I
understand completely.

1451
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:39,234
Okay.

1452
01:11:40,402 --> 01:11:41,837
Thank you.

1453
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:50,988
<i>Greetings
from Berkeley.</i>

1454
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:53,148
I am here to update
you on our progress

1455
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:54,715
and solicit your input.

1456
01:11:54,748 --> 01:11:56,127
To do so, I am going
to have to share

1457
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:59,821
a few things that General
Groves told me not to.

1458
01:11:59,855 --> 01:12:01,655
Sorry, General, I
said I understood,

1459
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:02,756
not that I agreed.

1460
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,326
'Kay.

1461
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:06,394
Gentlemen, to business.

1462
01:12:06,428 --> 01:12:08,796
There were rumors of
espionage at Los Alamos.

1463
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,308
Unsubstantiated.
Unsubstantiated.

1464
01:12:10,332 --> 01:12:11,799
I'm told

1465
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,144
that there were
Communists on the project.

1466
01:12:13,168 --> 01:12:14,936
We didn't knowingly
employ any Communists.

1467
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,746
I just want to know,
were any of them involved

1468
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:18,240
in discussions of the Super?

1469
01:12:18,273 --> 01:12:20,451
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1470
01:12:20,475 --> 01:12:22,743
My brother had left
the Party by then.

1471
01:12:22,776 --> 01:12:24,012
What about Lomanitz?

1472
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:25,779
Lomanitz was never
employed at Los Alamos.

1473
01:12:25,814 --> 01:12:26,815
He was a liaison.

1474
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,016
Our security was tight,

1475
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:29,427
as former Colonel
Nichols well knows.

1476
01:12:29,451 --> 01:12:31,019
Our security was as
tight as it could be

1477
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:32,420
given the
personalities involved,

1478
01:12:32,454 --> 01:12:34,289
but attempts were made.

1479
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:35,333
What is that supposed to mean?

1480
01:12:35,357 --> 01:12:36,925
We've all read his file here.

1481
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:39,961
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

1482
01:12:40,495 --> 01:12:42,663
Or the Chevalier incident?

1483
01:12:47,269 --> 01:12:48,669
'Scuse me.

1484
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:53,942
That's
Lomanitz, line one.

1485
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:00,849
Hello, Rossi.

1486
01:13:00,882 --> 01:13:04,085
<i>What? O-Okay, just calm down.</i>

1487
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:08,290
There's been another screw-up.
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1488
01:13:08,323 --> 01:13:10,791
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1489
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:12,827
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?

1490
01:13:12,861 --> 01:13:14,062
It wasn't a mistake.

1491
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:15,439
Your friend Lomanitz
has been trying

1492
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:17,731
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1493
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,067
He promised to quit all that.

1494
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,002
Well, he hasn't.

1495
01:13:21,036 --> 01:13:22,904
Security officer at
Berkeley's concerned about

1496
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:25,240
Communist infiltration
through that union,

1497
01:13:25,273 --> 01:13:27,876
- the F.A...
- F.A.E.C.T.

1498
01:13:30,278 --> 01:13:33,982
While I'm there next week,
I'll drop in to see him.

1499
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:37,986
Your Q clearance came through.

1500
01:13:41,523 --> 01:13:42,967
It's important you
not maintain or renew

1501
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:45,260
any questionable associations.

1502
01:13:49,998 --> 01:13:52,500
<i>Doctor, did you
think social contacts</i>

1503
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:54,869
between a person engaged
on secret war work

1504
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:56,271
and Communists was dangerous?

1505
01:13:56,304 --> 01:13:59,975
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1506
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:02,911
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1507
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:06,147
<i>you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous.</i>

1508
01:14:12,587 --> 01:14:15,557
<i>Were conceivably
dangerous, yes.</i>

1509
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,859
<i>I mean, really,</i>

1510
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:19,928
<i>known Communists.</i>

1511
01:14:22,063 --> 01:14:24,299
<i>Look...</i>

1512
01:14:24,332 --> 01:14:25,867
I've had a lot of secrets

1513
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,870
<i>in my head for a long time.</i>

1514
01:14:29,838 --> 01:14:31,115
<i>Doesn't matter who
I associate with.</i>

1515
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:34,042
I don't talk about
those secrets.

1516
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:43,084
You said
in your statement

1517
01:14:43,118 --> 01:14:49,057
that you had to see
Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1518
01:14:50,525 --> 01:14:52,193
You left.

1519
01:14:53,428 --> 01:14:54,863
Not a word.

1520
01:14:54,896 --> 01:14:57,365
What did you think
that would do to me?

1521
01:14:58,466 --> 01:14:59,534
I wrote.

1522
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:01,970
Pages of nothing.

1523
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,574
Where did you go?

1524
01:15:06,608 --> 01:15:09,044
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

1525
01:15:09,077 --> 01:15:11,813
Because you're a Communist.

1526
01:15:13,348 --> 01:15:15,216
Why did you have to see her?

1527
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,353
Because she had
indicated a great desire

1528
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:20,055
to see me before we left.

1529
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:21,256
At that time, I couldn't,

1530
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:25,093
but I felt that
she had to see me.

1531
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:27,629
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

1532
01:15:27,662 --> 01:15:29,898
She was extremely unhappy.

1533
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:31,933
Did you find out why
she had to see you?

1534
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:39,107
Because she was still
in love with me.

1535
01:15:46,314 --> 01:15:48,383
Spent the night
together, didn't you?

1536
01:15:56,358 --> 01:15:57,392
Yes.

1537
01:16:03,064 --> 01:16:06,935
You drop in and out of my life,

1538
01:16:06,968 --> 01:16:09,437
and you don't have
to tell me why.

1539
01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:10,939
Now that's power.

1540
01:16:10,972 --> 01:16:13,007
Not that I enjoy.

1541
01:16:13,975 --> 01:16:16,111
I'd rather be here
for you as you need.

1542
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:18,613
But you have other
priorities now.

1543
01:16:18,646 --> 01:16:21,416
I have a wife and child.

1544
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:25,220
That's not what either
of us is talking about.

1545
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:30,525
Jean.

1546
01:16:30,558 --> 01:16:32,694
You asked me to come.

1547
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:35,096
And I'm glad I did.

1548
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:38,299
But I can't see you again.

1549
01:16:40,702 --> 01:16:42,404
But what if I need you?

1550
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:48,943
You said you would
always answer.

1551
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:52,547
Not a word?

1552
01:16:53,816 --> 01:16:54,892
<i>Did you think that
consistent with good security?</i>

1553
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:57,585
As a matter of fact, it was.

1554
01:16:57,619 --> 01:16:59,988
<i>Not a word.</i>

1555
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:02,190
When did you
see her after that?

1556
01:17:10,598 --> 01:17:12,267
I never saw her again.

1557
01:17:18,473 --> 01:17:21,109
I can make the last
train back to Princeton.

1558
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:24,312
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1559
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:26,481
Today you said it to
history, didn't you?

1560
01:17:26,514 --> 01:17:28,049
This is a closed hearing.

1561
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:31,362
If they don't
release the transcript,

1562
01:17:31,386 --> 01:17:33,388
- I'm sure you will.
- I was under oath.

1563
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:35,190
Well, you were
under an oath for me

1564
01:17:35,223 --> 01:17:37,025
when you went to see Jean.

1565
01:17:37,692 --> 01:17:39,127
You know, you...

1566
01:17:40,028 --> 01:17:42,330
you sit there, day after day,

1567
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:45,400
letting them pick
our lives to pieces.

1568
01:17:48,403 --> 01:17:50,104
Why won't you fight?

1569
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:56,377
Robert, I'm
not putting her up there.

1570
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:04,385
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an
honor. Please, take a seat.

1571
01:18:04,419 --> 01:18:08,022
No need, um, I just wanted
to check whether I should

1572
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:10,225
talk to Lomanitz while I'm
here, given your concerns.

1573
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:12,360
Well, I'd say that's really
up to you, Professor,

1574
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:14,562
- but I'd be cautious.
- Uh-huh. Understood.

1575
01:18:14,596 --> 01:18:17,332
Oh, and, um,
as regards to the union,

1576
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:19,133
I wanted to give you
a heads-up on a...

1577
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,502
on a man named Eltenton.

1578
01:18:20,535 --> 01:18:22,036
A heads-up?

1579
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:26,007
Yes, just that he might
merit watching is all.

1580
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:28,243
Well, I'd love to
get more details.

1581
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:30,612
Well, I... I have
an appointment now

1582
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:32,080
and I leave early tomorrow.

1583
01:18:32,113 --> 01:18:33,648
Well, come back as
early as you like.

1584
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,017
Since you haven't time now.

1585
01:18:36,684 --> 01:18:38,520
You went back the next morning.

1586
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:40,555
I did, I had to, really.

1587
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:44,092
<i>This time, there
was another man.</i>

1588
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:46,261
He said his name's Pash.

1589
01:18:46,294 --> 01:18:48,796
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1590
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,374
Colonel Pash,
could you please read

1591
01:18:50,398 --> 01:18:54,202
from your memo
dated June 29, 1943?

1592
01:18:56,304 --> 01:18:58,406
"Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1593
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:01,276
"indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1594
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:03,478
"Subject met with and
spent considerable time

1595
01:19:03,511 --> 01:19:05,713
"with one Jean
Tatlock, Communist,

1596
01:19:05,747 --> 01:19:07,215
the record of whom is attached."

1597
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,117
The subject being
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1598
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:11,619
- Yes.
- Whom you had not met?

1599
01:19:11,653 --> 01:19:13,454
Not then,
but soon after.

1600
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:14,866
He's the head of
security for the project.

1601
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,124
Shouldn't I know him?

1602
01:19:16,157 --> 01:19:17,492
No, he should know you.

1603
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:19,427
I would never put you
in a room with Pash.

1604
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,728
Why not?

1605
01:19:20,762 --> 01:19:22,831
When Pash first
heard about Lomanitz,

1606
01:19:22,865 --> 01:19:25,800
he told the FBI he
was gonna kidnap him,

1607
01:19:25,834 --> 01:19:27,302
take him out on a boat

1608
01:19:27,335 --> 01:19:30,338
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

1609
01:19:32,473 --> 01:19:35,310
General Groves has placed in
me a certain responsibility,

1610
01:19:35,343 --> 01:19:37,579
and it's like having a
child who I can't see.

1611
01:19:37,612 --> 01:19:39,714
- Ah.
- By remote control.

1612
01:19:39,747 --> 01:19:43,351
So to actually meet you is...

1613
01:19:44,452 --> 01:19:45,897
I won't take up too
much of your time.

1614
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:48,189
No, no, not at all.
Whatever time you choose.

1615
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:51,125
Mm. Mr. Johnson told
me of a conversation

1616
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:52,904
you had yesterday in
which I'm very interested.

1617
01:19:52,928 --> 01:19:55,196
It's had me worried all day.

1618
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:57,732
Yes, well, I didn't
want to talk to Lomanitz

1619
01:19:57,765 --> 01:19:59,300
without authorization.

1620
01:19:59,334 --> 01:20:00,544
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

1621
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:02,537
It's something a
little bit more...

1622
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:05,340
well, in my opinion,
more serious.

1623
01:20:05,373 --> 01:20:08,309
Now, when the FBI pointed
out that such information

1624
01:20:08,343 --> 01:20:09,888
wouldn't be admissible in
court, Pash made it clear

1625
01:20:09,912 --> 01:20:13,681
he had no intention of leaving
any witness left to prosecute.

1626
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:15,283
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1627
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:16,885
but that's the man
you're dancing with.

1628
01:20:16,919 --> 01:20:19,621
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1629
01:20:19,654 --> 01:20:22,357
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab.

1630
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:26,294
A man attached to
the Soviet Consul

1631
01:20:26,327 --> 01:20:29,364
indicated, through
intermediate people,

1632
01:20:29,397 --> 01:20:30,933
to people on this project,

1633
01:20:30,966 --> 01:20:34,402
that he was in a position
to transmit information.

1634
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:37,271
Oh, why would anyone on the
project want to do that?

1635
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:41,242
Frankly, I can see that
there might be an argument

1636
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:43,678
for the Commander-in-Chief
informing the Russians...

1637
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:45,580
they're our allies after all...

1638
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:48,516
but I don't like the idea of
it going out the back door.

1639
01:20:48,549 --> 01:20:51,285
It might not hurt to be
on the lookout for it.

1640
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:53,856
And you said that to Pash?

1641
01:20:53,889 --> 01:20:55,390
I was trying to put it

1642
01:20:55,423 --> 01:20:58,259
in a context of
Russia's not Germany.

1643
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:02,697
Boris Pash is the son of
a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1644
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:06,234
Born here, but in 1918,
he went back to Russia

1645
01:21:06,267 --> 01:21:07,702
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1646
01:21:07,735 --> 01:21:09,914
This is a man who has killed
Communists with his own hands.

1647
01:21:09,938 --> 01:21:13,408
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1648
01:21:13,441 --> 01:21:15,486
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1649
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,712
Would you be a
little more specific?

1650
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:23,451
There's a man whose
name was mentioned to me

1651
01:21:23,484 --> 01:21:25,586
a couple of times. Eltenton.

1652
01:21:26,621 --> 01:21:29,724
Uh, I believe he's a
chemist who works at Shell.

1653
01:21:29,757 --> 01:21:32,293
He talked to a friend of his

1654
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:36,230
who's an acquaintance of
someone on the project.

1655
01:21:37,465 --> 01:21:39,902
And you thought Pash would
be satisfied with that?

1656
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:42,470
I was attempting to
give them Eltenton

1657
01:21:42,503 --> 01:21:43,839
without opening a can of worms.

1658
01:21:43,872 --> 01:21:45,841
I told them a
cock-and-bull story.

1659
01:21:45,874 --> 01:21:47,408
Did you lie to
General Groves too?

1660
01:21:47,442 --> 01:21:50,979
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1661
01:21:51,013 --> 01:21:52,456
Do you recall
this conversation

1662
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,883
about the Chevalier incident?

1663
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:57,318
I've seen so many
versions of it. Um...

1664
01:21:57,351 --> 01:21:58,519
Wasn't confused before,

1665
01:21:58,553 --> 01:21:59,988
but I'm certainly
getting there now.

1666
01:22:00,022 --> 01:22:01,331
And what
was your conclusion?

1667
01:22:01,355 --> 01:22:03,725
That he was under
the influence of

1668
01:22:03,758 --> 01:22:06,627
the typical American
schoolboy attitude

1669
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:10,264
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

1670
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:12,333
Well, now.

1671
01:22:12,366 --> 01:22:14,802
Might we know through
whom the contact was made?

1672
01:22:14,837 --> 01:22:17,039
That would in... involve people

1673
01:22:17,072 --> 01:22:19,041
who are not to be
involved in this.

1674
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:21,844
Is that someone a
member of the project?

1675
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:26,414
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

1676
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:27,548
Ah.

1677
01:22:27,582 --> 01:22:29,350
So Eltenton made his approach

1678
01:22:29,383 --> 01:22:32,620
through a member of the
faculty here at Berkeley?

1679
01:22:34,355 --> 01:22:36,825
As far as I know. As
far as I know, yes.

1680
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:39,494
But there-there may have been

1681
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:42,263
more than one person involved.

1682
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:48,871
Gentlemen, if I... if
I seem uncooperative,

1683
01:22:48,904 --> 01:22:51,840
I think you can understand
that's because of my insistence

1684
01:22:51,874 --> 01:22:54,475
in not getting innocent
people into trouble.

1685
01:22:54,509 --> 01:22:56,310
<i>You're trying
to protect your friend.</i>

1686
01:22:56,344 --> 01:22:57,578
Who's protecting you?

1687
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:59,014
Well, you could.

1688
01:22:59,047 --> 01:23:00,381
If you gave me the name.

1689
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:02,350
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1690
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:03,417
That's a mistake, Robert.

1691
01:23:03,451 --> 01:23:05,286
You need to volunteer this name.

1692
01:23:06,121 --> 01:23:07,789
<i>And did he
give you the name?</i>

1693
01:23:07,823 --> 01:23:08,957
<i>He did.</i>

1694
01:23:08,991 --> 01:23:10,458
- But not then, did he?
- No.

1695
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:11,970
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

1696
01:23:11,994 --> 01:23:13,896
It was.

1697
01:23:13,929 --> 01:23:15,030
You see me as persistent.

1698
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:16,798
Well, you are...

1699
01:23:16,832 --> 01:23:18,666
you are persistent,
but that is your job.

1700
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:22,403
And-and my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

1701
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:24,438
Instead of us
going on certain steps,

1702
01:23:24,472 --> 01:23:26,574
which may come to
your attention...

1703
01:23:27,943 --> 01:23:29,710
and be disturbing to you,

1704
01:23:29,744 --> 01:23:32,848
I would like to discuss
those with you first.

1705
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:34,382
I'm not formulating a plan.

1706
01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:36,751
I'll just have to
digest the whole thing.

1707
01:23:40,388 --> 01:23:43,091
<i>In the months in
between your interview</i>

1708
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:46,761
with Dr. Oppenheimer and his
eventual naming of Chevalier,

1709
01:23:46,794 --> 01:23:48,096
did you expend resources

1710
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,606
trying to find the name
of the intermediary?

1711
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,100
Considerable resources, yes.

1712
01:23:52,134 --> 01:23:54,368
Without the name, our job
was extremely difficult.

1713
01:23:54,402 --> 01:23:55,838
And when did you
receive the name?

1714
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:57,105
I was gone by the time

1715
01:23:57,139 --> 01:23:59,574
-Oppenheimer finally offered it up.
-Gone?

1716
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:01,776
They felt my time would
be better spent in Europe

1717
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:04,545
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1718
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:05,746
Who did?

1719
01:24:06,849 --> 01:24:08,583
General Groves.

1720
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:10,384
He transferred me to London.

1721
01:24:16,825 --> 01:24:18,927
<i>It's a little early
for a Christmas party.</i>

1722
01:24:18,961 --> 01:24:20,963
Something's up.

1723
01:24:20,996 --> 01:24:23,031
Tolman's been away.

1724
01:24:23,065 --> 01:24:24,765
Where?

1725
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:26,367
Ruth won't tell.

1726
01:24:30,906 --> 01:24:31,907
Hey!

1727
01:24:36,078 --> 01:24:37,612
Come on, Ruthie.

1728
01:24:37,645 --> 01:24:39,714
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

1729
01:24:39,747 --> 01:24:42,483
Compartmentalization,
Oppie.

1730
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:43,895
What makes you think I
know where he is anyway?

1731
01:24:43,919 --> 01:24:45,620
'Cause you
do a pretty good job

1732
01:24:45,653 --> 01:24:48,422
of knowing where Mr. Tolman
is when it counts.

1733
01:24:48,456 --> 01:24:49,992
Like now?

1734
01:24:50,025 --> 01:24:53,461
Attention!

1735
01:24:56,664 --> 01:24:58,599
Early Christmas
present for you all.

1736
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:09,044
<i>The British pilots
put me in the bomb bay.</i>

1737
01:25:09,077 --> 01:25:11,079
Showed me the-the
oxygen, you know,

1738
01:25:11,113 --> 01:25:12,848
but I messed it up.

1739
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:15,483
Uh, when they opened me up in
Scotland, I was unconscious.

1740
01:25:15,516 --> 01:25:17,718
But I pretended
I'd been napping.

1741
01:25:18,686 --> 01:25:20,122
Please enjoy your party.

1742
01:25:21,489 --> 01:25:22,790
Is
it big enough?

1743
01:25:22,824 --> 01:25:24,092
To end the war?

1744
01:25:24,126 --> 01:25:27,029
To end all war.

1745
01:25:29,865 --> 01:25:33,936
Uh, Heisenberg sought
me out in Copenhagen.

1746
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:35,703
It was chilling,

1747
01:25:35,736 --> 01:25:37,772
my old student
working for the Nazis.

1748
01:25:37,806 --> 01:25:41,709
He told me some
things to draw me out.

1749
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:45,948
Sustained fission
reactions in uranium.

1750
01:25:45,981 --> 01:25:48,183
That sounds more like
a reactor than a bomb.

1751
01:25:48,216 --> 01:25:49,650
Did he mention
gaseous diffusion?

1752
01:25:49,684 --> 01:25:51,954
He seemed more focused
on heavy water.

1753
01:25:51,987 --> 01:25:53,688
As a moderator?

1754
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:55,090
Yes, instead of graphite.

1755
01:25:58,126 --> 01:25:59,493
What?

1756
01:25:59,527 --> 01:26:01,696
He took a wrong turn.

1757
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:04,199
We're ahead. And with you
here to help us, Niels.

1758
01:26:04,232 --> 01:26:06,500
Sorry, could you...

1759
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:09,470
could you give us a
moment, gentlemen?

1760
01:26:15,643 --> 01:26:18,180
I am not here to help, Robert.

1761
01:26:18,213 --> 01:26:20,115
I knew you could
do this without me.

1762
01:26:20,148 --> 01:26:21,249
Then why did you come?

1763
01:26:21,283 --> 01:26:22,717
To talk about after.

1764
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,719
The power you're about to reveal

1765
01:26:24,752 --> 01:26:26,955
will forever outlive the Nazis.

1766
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:29,623
And the world is not prepared.

1767
01:26:29,657 --> 01:26:31,059
"You could lift the stone

1768
01:26:31,093 --> 01:26:33,728
without being ready for
the snake that's revealed."

1769
01:26:33,761 --> 01:26:35,139
We have to make the
politicians understand,

1770
01:26:35,163 --> 01:26:37,265
this isn't a new weapon.

1771
01:26:37,299 --> 01:26:38,766
It's a new world.

1772
01:26:38,799 --> 01:26:42,170
I'll be out there doing
what I can, but you...

1773
01:26:42,204 --> 01:26:44,772
you're an American Prometheus.

1774
01:26:44,806 --> 01:26:47,042
The man who gave them the power

1775
01:26:47,075 --> 01:26:49,111
to destroy themselves,

1776
01:26:49,144 --> 01:26:50,778
and they'll respect that.

1777
01:26:50,812 --> 01:26:52,981
And your work really begins.

1778
01:26:56,918 --> 01:27:00,055
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

1779
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:03,925
From San Francisco.

1780
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:11,900
Robert!

1781
01:27:15,137 --> 01:27:16,670
Robert?

1782
01:27:17,339 --> 01:27:19,908
Robert. Robert.

1783
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:22,144
God, what's the matter?

1784
01:27:22,177 --> 01:27:23,945
What happened?

1785
01:27:24,813 --> 01:27:26,747
Her father called.

1786
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:28,917
They found her
yesterday in the bath.

1787
01:27:29,918 --> 01:27:31,053
Who?

1788
01:27:32,054 --> 01:27:34,056
She'd taken pills.

1789
01:27:34,089 --> 01:27:35,991
<i>Left a note, not signed.</i>

1790
01:27:36,992 --> 01:27:37,959
She took barbiturates,

1791
01:27:37,993 --> 01:27:39,928
but there was chloral
hydrate in her blood.

1792
01:27:43,298 --> 01:27:44,632
There was a note.

1793
01:27:44,665 --> 01:27:46,968
Jean Tatlock?

1794
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,742
We were together.

1795
01:27:54,775 --> 01:27:57,578
She said she needed me. I...

1796
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,616
I told her I... I
wouldn't...

1797
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:04,286
I told her I couldn't...

1798
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:05,987
No, it was... it was me.

1799
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:11,093
You don't get to commit the sin

1800
01:28:11,126 --> 01:28:12,928
and then have us all
feel sorry for you

1801
01:28:12,961 --> 01:28:15,831
that it had consequences.

1802
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:20,102
You pull yourself together.

1803
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:25,907
You know, people
here depend on you.

1804
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:29,878
Donald, would you like

1805
01:28:29,911 --> 01:28:30,988
to contribute here?
Please, help me out.

1806
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:32,223
You're
on your own, pal.

1807
01:28:32,247 --> 01:28:33,357
Bob, I'm not quitting my job

1808
01:28:33,381 --> 01:28:34,715
because plutonium
is radioactive.

1809
01:28:34,748 --> 01:28:36,284
We just don't know
what it might do

1810
01:28:36,318 --> 01:28:38,053
to the female
reproductive system...

1811
01:28:38,086 --> 01:28:39,997
Your reproductive system is more
exposed than mine, presumably.

1812
01:28:40,021 --> 01:28:42,891
Can we please? The
implosion device is nowhere.

1813
01:28:42,924 --> 01:28:44,326
Hey, you can't rush everything.

1814
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:45,903
- Oppie, please.
- Well, there's rushing

1815
01:28:45,927 --> 01:28:47,728
and there's getting on
with it, so pick one.

1816
01:28:47,761 --> 01:28:49,763
Wait. Neddermeyer's
doing his job.

1817
01:28:49,797 --> 01:28:50,731
Teller's not helping.

1818
01:28:50,764 --> 01:28:52,300
You're not helping.

1819
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:53,734
I've been asking
for calculations

1820
01:28:53,767 --> 01:28:54,912
on the implosion
lenses for weeks.

1821
01:28:54,936 --> 01:28:56,404
The British can do it. Fuchs.

1822
01:28:56,438 --> 01:28:57,738
Absolutely.

1823
01:28:57,771 --> 01:28:59,141
It's your job, Teller.

1824
01:28:59,174 --> 01:29:00,976
I'm engaged in research.

1825
01:29:01,009 --> 01:29:03,677
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

1826
01:29:11,785 --> 01:29:13,155
I won't work for that man.

1827
01:29:14,923 --> 01:29:17,025
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

1828
01:29:17,058 --> 01:29:19,294
I agree. He
should leave Los Alamos.

1829
01:29:19,327 --> 01:29:20,829
Okay.

1830
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:22,730
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.

1831
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:24,166
Seth, I'm putting
you on plutonium.

1832
01:29:24,199 --> 01:29:27,302
Lilli, you go work for
Kisty. Because he needs you.

1833
01:29:27,335 --> 01:29:29,905
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1834
01:29:29,938 --> 01:29:32,307
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

1835
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:36,111
And no one is
leaving Los Alamos.

1836
01:29:50,358 --> 01:29:52,327
- They won't let me leave.
- No.

1837
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,962
I won't let you leave.

1838
01:29:54,829 --> 01:29:57,933
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1839
01:29:57,966 --> 01:30:01,102
Stay here, research
what you want.

1840
01:30:01,136 --> 01:30:03,737
Fusion, the hydrogen
bomb, whatever.

1841
01:30:03,771 --> 01:30:04,940
We'll meet to discuss.

1842
01:30:04,973 --> 01:30:06,441
You don't have time to meet.

1843
01:30:06,474 --> 01:30:08,043
You're a politician now, Robert.

1844
01:30:08,076 --> 01:30:10,711
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

1845
01:30:11,546 --> 01:30:13,348
Once a week.

1846
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:15,250
One hour. You and me.

1847
01:30:20,422 --> 01:30:22,991
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1848
01:30:26,928 --> 01:30:29,364
<i>So the Super
was under development</i>

1849
01:30:29,397 --> 01:30:31,366
<i>on your watch at Los Alamos?</i>

1850
01:30:31,399 --> 01:30:32,901
Yes.

1851
01:30:32,934 --> 01:30:34,802
And yet, after the war,

1852
01:30:34,836 --> 01:30:36,438
you tried to deny it was viable.

1853
01:30:36,471 --> 01:30:37,973
No, no, no. I...

1854
01:30:38,006 --> 01:30:39,841
I pointed out technical
difficulties with it.

1855
01:30:39,874 --> 01:30:41,519
You... Didn't you try to
kill it at the AEC meeting

1856
01:30:41,543 --> 01:30:43,111
- after the Russian bomb test?
- No.

1857
01:30:43,144 --> 01:30:45,247
But that was the
recommendation of the AEC,

1858
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,549
- was it not?
- After hours of discussion

1859
01:30:47,582 --> 01:30:49,851
<i>about the best response.</i>

1860
01:30:49,884 --> 01:30:54,990
An H-bomb is 1,000 times
the power of an A-bomb.

1861
01:30:56,157 --> 01:30:59,928
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

1862
01:30:59,961 --> 01:31:02,063
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

1863
01:31:02,097 --> 01:31:04,399
Izzy, draw some circles
on this side of the map

1864
01:31:04,432 --> 01:31:06,067
where they would target us.

1865
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:08,136
- Starting with New York. D.C.
- That's fair.

1866
01:31:08,169 --> 01:31:10,939
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

1867
01:31:10,972 --> 01:31:12,507
- Deterrence.
- "Deterrence"?

1868
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,142
Do we really need
more deterrence

1869
01:31:14,175 --> 01:31:16,578
than our current
arsenal of atomic bombs?

1870
01:31:16,611 --> 01:31:19,314
Y-You drown in ten feet
of water or-or 10,000,

1871
01:31:19,347 --> 01:31:21,025
what's the difference?

1872
01:31:21,049 --> 01:31:23,018
We can already drown
Russia. They know it.

1873
01:31:23,051 --> 01:31:25,329
- And now they can drown us.
- So we're just escalating...

1874
01:31:36,231 --> 01:31:39,067
As I said, Teller's
designs are still as

1875
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,036
impractical as they
were during the war.

1876
01:31:41,069 --> 01:31:44,039
A hydrogen bomb can be made
to work, Oppie, you know that.

1877
01:31:44,072 --> 01:31:45,216
I don't believe we should commit

1878
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,142
all our resources
to that chance.

1879
01:31:47,175 --> 01:31:50,045
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

1880
01:31:50,078 --> 01:31:52,280
Simply by limiting the
spread of atomic weapons

1881
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:55,617
through international
control on nuclear energy.

1882
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:57,218
By which you mean
world government?

1883
01:31:57,252 --> 01:32:00,188
The United Nations as
Roosevelt intended.

1884
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:03,124
Well, I... I asked what
Truman should do, right?

1885
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:06,061
The world's changed, it's
not fascism but Communism

1886
01:32:06,094 --> 01:32:07,562
that now threatens our survival.

1887
01:32:07,595 --> 01:32:11,232
Lewis, do you understand,
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1888
01:32:11,266 --> 01:32:14,135
the Russians will have no
choice but to build their own?

1889
01:32:14,169 --> 01:32:15,937
Could they be working
on one already?

1890
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,473
Based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos.

1891
01:32:18,506 --> 01:32:19,974
No spy at Los Alamos.

1892
01:32:20,008 --> 01:32:21,085
- Gentlemen.
- There wasn't?

1893
01:32:21,109 --> 01:32:22,344
Let's not get sidetracked.

1894
01:32:22,377 --> 01:32:24,079
I say we use this moment

1895
01:32:24,112 --> 01:32:25,523
to gain concessions
from the Russians

1896
01:32:25,547 --> 01:32:28,616
by committing that we will
not build a hydrogen bomb.

1897
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:30,285
Thereby revealing its existence.

1898
01:32:30,318 --> 01:32:32,320
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

1899
01:32:32,354 --> 01:32:33,955
All right.

1900
01:32:33,988 --> 01:32:36,091
At this point, I'd like
the committee members

1901
01:32:36,124 --> 01:32:40,061
to meet in privacy to
finalize our recommendations.

1902
01:32:41,196 --> 01:32:43,198
I'm just not sure you
want to go down this road.

1903
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:45,500
Lewis, with respect, we
are the advisory committee,

1904
01:32:45,533 --> 01:32:47,302
we will give them our advice.

1905
01:32:47,335 --> 01:32:48,436
Good night.

1906
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:56,911
Dr. Oppenheimer?
Hi. William Borden.

1907
01:32:56,945 --> 01:32:58,279
Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy?

1908
01:32:58,313 --> 01:32:59,514
Oh, yes, yes.

1909
01:32:59,547 --> 01:33:01,182
During the war, I was a pilot.

1910
01:33:02,317 --> 01:33:05,053
One night, flying
back from a raid,

1911
01:33:05,086 --> 01:33:07,989
I saw an amazing
sight like a meteor.

1912
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:11,960
<i>A V-2 rocket headed to England.</i>

1913
01:33:11,993 --> 01:33:13,995
I can't help but
imagine what it will be

1914
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:17,932
for such an enemy rocket
to carry an atomic warhead.

1915
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:28,052
Well, let's make sure
we're not the ones

1916
01:33:28,076 --> 01:33:29,377
to make that possible.

1917
01:33:36,084 --> 01:33:38,987
Oppie, I don't think you want
to go up against Strauss.

1918
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:41,089
If we both speak,
they listen to me.

1919
01:33:41,122 --> 01:33:43,191
When you speak,
they hear a prophet.

1920
01:33:43,224 --> 01:33:45,193
When Strauss speaks,
they hear themselves.

1921
01:33:45,226 --> 01:33:47,028
They'll listen to a prophet.

1922
01:33:47,061 --> 01:33:50,331
A prophet can't be
wrong. Not once.

1923
01:33:50,365 --> 01:33:52,133
<i>Didn't
you accuse Oppenheimer</i>

1924
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:54,068
<i>of sabotaging the
development of the Super?</i>

1925
01:33:54,102 --> 01:33:55,703
I was never one of those

1926
01:33:55,737 --> 01:33:59,007
to bandy around terms
like "sabotage."

1927
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,009
<i>But
Mr. Borden was?</i>

1928
01:34:01,042 --> 01:34:02,310
As I understand it, possibly.

1929
01:34:02,343 --> 01:34:04,446
How was Mr. Borden
able to put together

1930
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:05,747
such a detailed indictment?

1931
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:07,315
<i>He was no longer a
government employee,</i>

1932
01:34:07,348 --> 01:34:09,984
yet he appears to have
had unlimited access

1933
01:34:10,018 --> 01:34:11,519
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1934
01:34:11,553 --> 01:34:14,456
<i>Might Mr. Nichols have given
him access to the file?</i>

1935
01:34:14,489 --> 01:34:16,391
Or someone else, at the AEC?

1936
01:34:16,424 --> 01:34:19,260
That's a very serious
accusation, Senator.

1937
01:34:19,294 --> 01:34:21,763
Is it your intention to
suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer

1938
01:34:21,796 --> 01:34:23,731
is disloyal to
the United States?

1939
01:34:23,765 --> 01:34:26,301
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

1940
01:34:26,334 --> 01:34:29,037
that he's loyal to
the United States.

1941
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,514
I believe this. And
I shall believe it

1942
01:34:30,538 --> 01:34:33,341
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

1943
01:34:33,374 --> 01:34:35,143
<i>Do you or
do you not believe</i>

1944
01:34:35,176 --> 01:34:37,545
<i>that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?</i>

1945
01:34:45,753 --> 01:34:47,388
And if I may,

1946
01:34:47,422 --> 01:34:50,225
when Hitler blew his
brains out in that bunker,

1947
01:34:50,258 --> 01:34:51,803
it's my humble opinion
that there is no need

1948
01:34:51,827 --> 01:34:53,294
for that bomb to
be seen anywhere

1949
01:34:53,328 --> 01:34:55,096
except for that test site.

1950
01:34:55,129 --> 01:34:57,131
But we at least
have to take a moment

1951
01:34:57,165 --> 01:34:59,167
to think about whether the means

1952
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,469
justify the ends any
longer, because...

1953
01:35:03,805 --> 01:35:06,374
Germany is about to surrender.

1954
01:35:08,276 --> 01:35:11,613
It's no longer the enemy
who are the greatest threat

1955
01:35:11,646 --> 01:35:13,448
to mankind, it's our work.

1956
01:35:15,851 --> 01:35:18,586
Hitler's dead, it's true.

1957
01:35:20,288 --> 01:35:21,824
But the Japanese fight on.

1958
01:35:21,857 --> 01:35:23,525
Their defeat seems assured.

1959
01:35:23,558 --> 01:35:26,561
Not if you're a G.I.
preparing to invade.

1960
01:35:27,863 --> 01:35:29,163
We can end this war.

1961
01:35:29,197 --> 01:35:30,598
But
how do we justify

1962
01:35:30,632 --> 01:35:32,200
using this weapon
on human beings?

1963
01:35:35,236 --> 01:35:38,640
We're theorists, yes?

1964
01:35:38,673 --> 01:35:40,275
Yes. Yep.

1965
01:35:40,308 --> 01:35:44,345
We imagine a future and
our imaginings horrify us.

1966
01:35:45,413 --> 01:35:47,549
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

1967
01:35:47,582 --> 01:35:50,485
and they won't understand
it until they've used it.

1968
01:35:50,518 --> 01:35:51,686
When the world learns

1969
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:54,222
the terrible secret
of Los Alamos,

1970
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:57,692
our work here will ensure a
peace mankind has never seen.

1971
01:35:57,725 --> 01:36:01,095
A peace based on the kind
of international cooperation

1972
01:36:01,129 --> 01:36:03,164
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1973
01:36:08,269 --> 01:36:09,504
<i>Progress?</i>

1974
01:36:09,537 --> 01:36:12,307
Two years and a
billion dollars' worth?

1975
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,108
Well, hard to put a price on it.

1976
01:36:14,142 --> 01:36:15,710
Not really, just
add up the bills.

1977
01:36:15,743 --> 01:36:17,445
"Rural free deliveries."

1978
01:36:17,478 --> 01:36:20,248
Eighty babies delivered
the first year.

1979
01:36:20,281 --> 01:36:22,617
This year, we've
had ten a month.

1980
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,386
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

1981
01:36:26,254 --> 01:36:28,590
- Clearly.
- General.

1982
01:36:33,561 --> 01:36:34,897
Head down, everyone.

1983
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:37,098
Fuchs, head down.

1984
01:36:39,601 --> 01:36:40,768
Hmm?

1985
01:36:43,638 --> 01:36:45,373
That's the one.

1986
01:36:45,406 --> 01:36:48,309
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

1987
01:36:50,612 --> 01:36:52,447
September.

1988
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,481
July.

1989
01:36:53,514 --> 01:36:55,450
That's the sweet
spot, gentlemen.

1990
01:36:55,483 --> 01:36:57,652
August.

1991
01:36:57,685 --> 01:36:59,420
July.

1992
01:36:59,454 --> 01:37:01,255
Test in July.

1993
01:37:01,289 --> 01:37:02,925
But I need my brother.

1994
01:37:07,295 --> 01:37:09,239
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

1995
01:37:09,263 --> 01:37:11,699
he's been working with
Lawrence for two years now.

1996
01:37:18,673 --> 01:37:20,508
What do we call the test?

1997
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:25,380
"Batter my heart,
three-person'd god."

1998
01:37:25,413 --> 01:37:26,514
What?

1999
01:37:27,883 --> 01:37:29,283
Trinity.

2000
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:38,326
You insisted

2001
01:37:38,359 --> 01:37:39,670
on bringing on
your brother Frank,

2002
01:37:39,694 --> 01:37:41,305
- a known Communist.
- A former Communist.

2003
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:43,765
You brought a known
former Communist

2004
01:37:43,798 --> 01:37:47,669
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

2005
01:37:47,702 --> 01:37:50,805
I knew my brother could
be trusted. Absolutely.

2006
01:37:50,839 --> 01:37:52,808
And you felt your
judgment was sound

2007
01:37:52,841 --> 01:37:54,676
on who on the team
could be trusted?

2008
01:37:55,677 --> 01:37:56,812
Fuchs, head down.

2009
01:37:56,845 --> 01:37:58,579
Okay, everybody ready?

2010
01:37:59,948 --> 01:38:01,884
Hmm?

2011
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,685
Oh.

2012
01:38:06,822 --> 01:38:07,956
Oh.

2013
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:09,724
Well, I hope you
learned something.

2014
01:38:09,757 --> 01:38:11,669
Yeah, we learned we're gonna
need to be a lot further away.

2015
01:38:11,693 --> 01:38:13,261
Well, figure it out. Fast.

2016
01:38:13,294 --> 01:38:14,963
We leave for Washington
in the morning.

2017
01:38:14,997 --> 01:38:17,198
We're gonna give them a date.

2018
01:38:31,345 --> 01:38:33,015
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

2019
01:38:33,048 --> 01:38:34,549
If we don't act now,

2020
01:38:34,582 --> 01:38:36,293
they're going to use
this thing against Japan.

2021
01:38:36,317 --> 01:38:38,286
We booked a meeting with Truman,

2022
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:39,587
but somebody killed it.

2023
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,489
You're meeting the
Secretary of War.

2024
01:38:41,522 --> 01:38:43,691
Just because we're building it,

2025
01:38:43,725 --> 01:38:45,727
doesn't mean we get to
decide how it's used.

2026
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,529
History will judge us, Robert.

2027
01:38:48,563 --> 01:38:51,867
In Chicago, we put
together a petition.

2028
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,836
I'm not... I'm not
getting into that.

2029
01:38:58,907 --> 01:39:00,843
Just tell me your concerns,
and I'll relay them.

2030
01:39:00,876 --> 01:39:01,977
My concerns?

2031
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,979
Germany's defeated.

2032
01:39:04,012 --> 01:39:05,780
Japan's not going
to hold out alone.

2033
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:07,715
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

2034
01:39:07,749 --> 01:39:09,526
You and Einstein with
your letter to Roosevelt

2035
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:12,353
- saying we could build a bomb.
- Against Germany.

2036
01:39:12,386 --> 01:39:15,323
That's not how weapons
manufacture works, Szilard.

2037
01:39:15,356 --> 01:39:16,500
Oppie,
you have to help.

2038
01:39:16,524 --> 01:39:17,826
Fermi's
in the meeting.

2039
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,436
- Lawrence is in the meeting.
- They're not you.

2040
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:21,629
You're the great
salesman of science.

2041
01:39:21,662 --> 01:39:24,265
You can convince
anyone of anything.

2042
01:39:24,967 --> 01:39:26,367
Even yourself.

2043
01:39:26,969 --> 01:39:28,369
'Scuse me.

2044
01:39:29,403 --> 01:39:32,673
The firestorm in Tokyo
killed 100,000 people.

2045
01:39:32,707 --> 01:39:34,509
Mostly civilians.

2046
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:37,079
I worry about an America
where we do these things

2047
01:39:37,112 --> 01:39:38,847
and no one protests.

2048
01:39:38,881 --> 01:39:41,917
Pearl Harbor and three years of
brutal conflict in the Pacific

2049
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,485
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

2050
01:39:44,519 --> 01:39:46,554
Enough to
unleash the atomic bomb?

2051
01:39:46,587 --> 01:39:48,456
Uh, the A-bomb
might not cause

2052
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:50,391
as much damage as
the Tokyo bombings.

2053
01:39:50,424 --> 01:39:51,793
What are we estimating?

2054
01:39:51,827 --> 01:39:54,662
In a medium-size city, uh,

2055
01:39:54,695 --> 01:39:56,098
20 or 30,000 dead.

2056
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:57,933
Yes, but, uh,

2057
01:39:57,966 --> 01:40:01,003
don't underestimate the
psychological impact of a...

2058
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:02,436
of an atomic explosion.

2059
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:06,707
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

2060
01:40:06,741 --> 01:40:10,078
Deadly neutron effects for
a mile, in all directions,

2061
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:13,015
from one single device.

2062
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:15,383
Dropped from a
barely noticed B-29,

2063
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:17,685
the atomic bomb will be

2064
01:40:17,718 --> 01:40:20,555
a terrible revelation
of divine power.

2065
01:40:20,588 --> 01:40:23,859
If that's true, it
would be definitive.

2066
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:25,961
World War II would be over.

2067
01:40:25,994 --> 01:40:27,695
Our boys would come home.

2068
01:40:27,728 --> 01:40:28,864
Military targets?

2069
01:40:29,998 --> 01:40:32,667
Uh, there aren't any big enough.

2070
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:38,472
Perhaps a vital war plant
with workers housed nearby.

2071
01:40:38,506 --> 01:40:40,843
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

2072
01:40:40,876 --> 01:40:43,045
They'd send everything
they have up against us,

2073
01:40:43,078 --> 01:40:44,679
and I'd be up in that plane.

2074
01:40:44,712 --> 01:40:47,916
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

2075
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:50,651
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

2076
01:40:50,685 --> 01:40:53,788
Is there no way to
demonstrate a bomb to Japan

2077
01:40:53,822 --> 01:40:55,523
to provoke surrender?

2078
01:40:55,556 --> 01:40:58,626
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms.

2079
01:40:58,659 --> 01:40:59,360
Twice.

2080
01:40:59,393 --> 01:41:01,462
Once to show the weapon's power

2081
01:41:01,495 --> 01:41:03,999
and a second to show that
we can keep doing this

2082
01:41:04,032 --> 01:41:05,533
until they surrender.

2083
01:41:05,566 --> 01:41:08,937
We have a list of 12
cities to choose from...

2084
01:41:08,971 --> 01:41:10,873
Sorry, 11.

2085
01:41:10,906 --> 01:41:12,607
I've taken Kyoto off the list

2086
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:16,444
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

2087
01:41:16,477 --> 01:41:19,114
Also, my wife and I
honeymooned there.

2088
01:41:19,147 --> 01:41:20,648
It's a magnificent city.

2089
01:41:24,219 --> 01:41:25,921
Let me make this simple
for you, gentlemen.

2090
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:28,456
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

2091
01:41:28,489 --> 01:41:30,926
the Japanese people
will not surrender

2092
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:32,727
under any circumstances

2093
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:36,164
short of a successful and total
invasion of the home islands.

2094
01:41:36,198 --> 01:41:39,167
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

2095
01:41:39,201 --> 01:41:41,435
The use of the atomic
bomb on Japanese cities

2096
01:41:41,469 --> 01:41:43,437
will save lives.

2097
01:41:43,471 --> 01:41:45,773
If we retain moral advantage.

2098
01:41:45,807 --> 01:41:47,943
- How so?
- Well, if we use this weapon

2099
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:50,913
without informing our allies,
they'll see it as a threat.

2100
01:41:50,946 --> 01:41:52,114
And we'll be in an arms race.

2101
01:41:52,147 --> 01:41:54,216
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

2102
01:41:54,249 --> 01:41:55,817
Secrecy won't
stop the Soviets

2103
01:41:55,851 --> 01:41:58,220
from becoming part
of the atomic world.

2104
01:41:58,253 --> 01:42:00,554
We've been told they
have no uranium.

2105
01:42:00,588 --> 01:42:01,789
You've been misinformed.

2106
01:42:01,823 --> 01:42:03,658
A Russian bomb is
a matter of time.

2107
01:42:03,691 --> 01:42:07,095
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

2108
01:42:07,129 --> 01:42:09,730
Uh, Secretary
Stimson, if I may...

2109
01:42:09,764 --> 01:42:13,768
Not all scientists on the
project are in agreement.

2110
01:42:13,801 --> 01:42:16,671
In fact, this might be a moment
to consider other opinions.

2111
01:42:16,704 --> 01:42:18,615
- If you talk a scientist in...
- The Manhattan Project

2112
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,008
has been plagued from the start

2113
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:23,845
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

2114
01:42:23,879 --> 01:42:24,947
and uncertain loyalty.

2115
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:27,215
One of them just tried to
meet with the president.

2116
01:42:27,249 --> 01:42:29,084
Now, we need these men,

2117
01:42:29,117 --> 01:42:30,651
but as soon as it's practical,

2118
01:42:30,685 --> 01:42:32,955
we should sever any such
scientists from the program.

2119
01:42:32,988 --> 01:42:34,555
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

2120
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:37,525
If a Russian
bomb is inevitable,

2121
01:42:37,558 --> 01:42:40,829
perhaps we should invite their
top scientists to Trinity.

2122
01:42:40,862 --> 01:42:43,165
President Truman
has no intention

2123
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:44,765
of raising expectations

2124
01:42:44,799 --> 01:42:47,601
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

2125
01:42:47,635 --> 01:42:49,004
Informing him of
our breakthrough

2126
01:42:49,037 --> 01:42:50,647
and presenting it as
a means to win the war

2127
01:42:50,671 --> 01:42:53,574
need not make
unkeepable promises.

2128
01:42:53,607 --> 01:42:55,153
But the Potsdam peace
conference in July

2129
01:42:55,177 --> 01:42:57,079
will be President
Truman's last chance

2130
01:42:57,112 --> 01:42:59,247
to have that conversation.

2131
01:42:59,281 --> 01:43:01,183
Can you give us a
working bomb by then?

2132
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:05,887
Absolutely. We will test
fire before the conference.

2133
01:43:10,624 --> 01:43:13,161
<i>Ground zero
observation posts</i>

2134
01:43:13,195 --> 01:43:14,662
<i>at 10,000 yards</i>

2135
01:43:14,695 --> 01:43:16,865
north, south and west.

2136
01:43:16,898 --> 01:43:20,202
- Where do we trigger from?
- Uh, south 10,000.

2137
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:23,571
And base camp is ten
miles south, here.

2138
01:43:23,604 --> 01:43:26,540
And there's a further
observation post

2139
01:43:26,574 --> 01:43:28,743
on-on that hill 20 miles away.

2140
01:43:28,776 --> 01:43:31,746
What's that, Frank? Trigger
lines already went in.

2141
01:43:31,779 --> 01:43:35,283
The Air Force requested a
line of lights for their B-29.

2142
01:43:35,317 --> 01:43:37,752
What B-29? Our
bomb's on the tower.

2143
01:43:37,785 --> 01:43:39,154
They want
to use the test

2144
01:43:39,187 --> 01:43:41,023
to confirm a safe
operating distance.

2145
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,290
That's risky.

2146
01:43:42,324 --> 01:43:43,959
Not as risky as
dropping one over Japan

2147
01:43:43,992 --> 01:43:45,769
and hoping that we were
right about the blast radius.

2148
01:43:45,793 --> 01:43:47,905
Don't let them slow us down,
we're firing on the 15th.

2149
01:43:47,929 --> 01:43:51,166
- The 15th? That's not...
- The 15th.

2150
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:53,534
The 15th.

2151
01:43:54,635 --> 01:43:56,580
So I'll be here
at South Observation point

2152
01:43:56,604 --> 01:43:58,807
<i>with Frank and Kistiakowsky.</i>

2153
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:01,343
You'll all be
assigned to Base Camp,

2154
01:44:01,376 --> 01:44:04,578
West Observation
or Far Observation.

2155
01:44:14,222 --> 01:44:16,124
Whoa, whoa. Careful
with the knife.

2156
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:18,592
There, carefully.

2157
01:44:19,693 --> 01:44:21,229
Are those safe distances?

2158
01:44:21,263 --> 01:44:23,764
They're based on
your calculations.

2159
01:44:23,798 --> 01:44:26,700
Time to stand behind your
science, Hans. Literally.

2160
01:44:50,125 --> 01:44:51,592
Yeah.

2161
01:44:56,264 --> 01:44:58,100
What 'bout the radiation cloud?

2162
01:44:58,133 --> 01:44:59,367
Without high winds,

2163
01:44:59,401 --> 01:45:00,978
it should settle within
two to three miles.

2164
01:45:01,002 --> 01:45:03,405
Evacuation measures
are in place.

2165
01:45:03,438 --> 01:45:05,240
But we need good
weather for visibility,

2166
01:45:05,273 --> 01:45:06,740
so it has to be fine.

2167
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:09,111
Everybody out.

2168
01:45:19,287 --> 01:45:20,431
We go on the night of the 15th.

2169
01:45:20,455 --> 01:45:22,390
It's a hard deadline,

2170
01:45:22,424 --> 01:45:25,726
so if anyone has
anything, speak now.

2171
01:45:26,428 --> 01:45:27,761
Okay, stop, stop.

2172
01:45:27,795 --> 01:45:29,663
Everybody, mattresses.

2173
01:45:29,697 --> 01:45:31,765
Put the mattress underneath.

2174
01:45:48,749 --> 01:45:51,652
Could use a final
implosion test.

2175
01:45:52,354 --> 01:45:54,322
It couldn't hurt.

2176
01:45:54,356 --> 01:45:55,857
Do it.

2177
01:45:56,825 --> 01:45:59,127
Is there anything else
that might stop us?

2178
01:46:33,228 --> 01:46:36,131
It's happening, isn't it?

2179
01:46:37,232 --> 01:46:39,000
I'll send a message.

2180
01:46:39,868 --> 01:46:42,504
If it's gone our way,

2181
01:46:42,537 --> 01:46:44,105
take in the sheets.

2182
01:46:48,143 --> 01:46:49,177
Robert?

2183
01:46:51,846 --> 01:46:53,281
Break a leg.

2184
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:02,984
Oppie's taken a very
modest three kilotons.

2185
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:05,387
- Teller's in with 45.
- 20.

2186
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:07,856
Twenty thousand tons of TNT,

2187
01:48:07,889 --> 01:48:09,291
and does anyone
want the side action

2188
01:48:09,324 --> 01:48:12,060
on atmospheric ignition?

2189
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:15,964
Are you saying
we'll have to delay?

2190
01:48:15,997 --> 01:48:17,174
I'm saying it would be prudent.

2191
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:18,442
This weather, has
it reached the site?

2192
01:48:24,272 --> 01:48:26,250
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

2193
01:48:26,274 --> 01:48:27,909
Hello, Hans.

2194
01:48:27,942 --> 01:48:29,344
Yes, he's here.

2195
01:48:30,178 --> 01:48:31,513
Yes.

2196
01:48:34,082 --> 01:48:35,283
- Is he wrong?
- No.

2197
01:48:35,317 --> 01:48:37,218
- No?
- No.

2198
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:39,621
So we're about to fire a dud?

2199
01:48:39,654 --> 01:48:41,122
- No.
- Explain.

2200
01:48:41,156 --> 01:48:43,925
Well, I can't. I
just... I-I just know.

2201
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:45,627
I know the implosion
lenses will work.

2202
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,062
If we fire these detonators

2203
01:48:47,095 --> 01:48:48,339
and they don't
trigger a reaction,

2204
01:48:48,363 --> 01:48:50,031
two years' worth of plutonium

2205
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:51,475
will be scattered
across White Sands.

2206
01:48:51,499 --> 01:48:55,403
A month of my salary against
ten bucks says it lights.

2207
01:48:55,437 --> 01:48:57,439
Jesus.

2208
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:05,647
The wind's picking
up at zero, not the rain.

2209
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,115
Lightning's circling.

2210
01:49:07,148 --> 01:49:08,592
You think it might be
time to tell your men

2211
01:49:08,616 --> 01:49:11,519
to get away from the steel
tower with the atomic bomb?

2212
01:49:14,656 --> 01:49:16,624
Let's get to South Observation.

2213
01:49:16,658 --> 01:49:18,126
Pull 'em out.

2214
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:19,570
We can make our
determination there.

2215
01:49:24,966 --> 01:49:26,968
The team hasn't
slept in two nights.

2216
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:29,003
If we stand down,
make the bomb safe,

2217
01:49:29,037 --> 01:49:30,372
we won't be back here for weeks.

2218
01:49:30,405 --> 01:49:32,073
Then we'll miss Potsdam.

2219
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:34,008
I gotta get word
to Truman by 7:00.

2220
01:49:34,042 --> 01:49:35,276
Our window's closing.

2221
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:36,378
What is this doing?

2222
01:49:36,411 --> 01:49:37,912
Raining, blowing, lightning.

2223
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:39,981
- For how long, damn it?
- It's holdin' strong.

2224
01:49:40,014 --> 01:49:41,316
It'll break before dawn.

2225
01:49:41,349 --> 01:49:43,027
- How could you know that?
- I know this desert.

2226
01:49:43,051 --> 01:49:44,152
Storm cools overnight.

2227
01:49:44,185 --> 01:49:45,987
Just before dawn,
the storm breaks.

2228
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:48,223
He could be right, but
schedule as late as possible.

2229
01:49:48,256 --> 01:49:49,991
5:30!

2230
01:49:50,024 --> 01:49:51,059
Sign your forecast.

2231
01:49:51,092 --> 01:49:52,169
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2232
01:49:52,193 --> 01:49:53,995
Frank, tell them all, 5:30.

2233
01:49:54,028 --> 01:49:56,164
- 5:30, 5:30.
- 5:30.

2234
01:49:58,366 --> 01:50:03,304
Three years, 4,000
people, $2 billion.

2235
01:50:03,338 --> 01:50:05,707
Well, if it doesn't
go off...

2236
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:07,342
we're both finished.

2237
01:50:10,111 --> 01:50:12,080
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2238
01:50:13,047 --> 01:50:14,492
Anything less, they
won't get what it is.

2239
01:50:14,516 --> 01:50:19,087
What did Fermi mean by
"atmospheric ignition"?

2240
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,598
Well, we had a moment
where it looked like

2241
01:50:20,622 --> 01:50:24,459
the chain reaction from an
atomic device might never stop.

2242
01:50:25,693 --> 01:50:27,729
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2243
01:50:27,762 --> 01:50:29,731
Why is Fermi still
taking side bets on it?

2244
01:50:29,764 --> 01:50:32,934
Call it gallows humor.

2245
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:38,072
Wait, are we saying
there's a chance

2246
01:50:38,106 --> 01:50:39,974
that when we push that button,

2247
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:41,342
we destroy the world?

2248
01:50:41,376 --> 01:50:43,545
Nothing in our research
over three years

2249
01:50:43,578 --> 01:50:45,213
supports that conclusion.

2250
01:50:45,246 --> 01:50:48,216
Except as the most
remote possibility.

2251
01:50:48,249 --> 01:50:49,584
How remote?

2252
01:50:49,617 --> 01:50:51,219
Chances are near zero.

2253
01:50:52,554 --> 01:50:53,955
Near zero?

2254
01:50:54,722 --> 01:50:57,292
What do you want
from theory alone?

2255
01:50:58,793 --> 01:51:01,162
Zero would be nice.

2256
01:51:04,466 --> 01:51:06,100
In exactly

2257
01:51:06,134 --> 01:51:09,437
one hour, 58 minutes,

2258
01:51:09,471 --> 01:51:11,005
we'll know.

2259
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:18,246
It's letting up.

2260
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:33,495
The arming party's left Zero,
they're heading this way.

2261
01:51:33,528 --> 01:51:34,496
Throwing the switches.

2262
01:51:34,529 --> 01:51:35,630
Turn the cars.

2263
01:51:35,663 --> 01:51:38,132
Ready for emergency evacuation.

2264
01:51:55,818 --> 01:51:57,058
Welder's glass.

2265
01:51:57,085 --> 01:51:58,653
Everybody take your places.

2266
01:51:58,686 --> 01:52:01,189
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2267
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:04,559
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2268
01:52:55,777 --> 01:52:57,178
Twenty minutes.

2269
01:53:00,682 --> 01:53:02,517
Twenty minutes.

2270
01:53:13,695 --> 01:53:15,229
That's 20.

2271
01:53:18,232 --> 01:53:19,701
On the leg, please.

2272
01:53:21,235 --> 01:53:23,738
- Feynman.
- No.

2273
01:53:23,771 --> 01:53:25,740
The glass. Stops the U.V.

2274
01:53:25,773 --> 01:53:27,575
And what stops the glass?

2275
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:31,546
I'm gonna head to base
camp. Best of luck.

2276
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,215
Robert.

2277
01:53:34,817 --> 01:53:36,651
Try not to blow up the world.

2278
01:53:48,529 --> 01:53:49,631
Watch that needle.

2279
01:53:49,664 --> 01:53:51,232
If the detonators don't charge

2280
01:53:51,265 --> 01:53:53,201
or the voltage drops
below one volt,

2281
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:55,236
you hit that button, you abort.

2282
01:53:55,269 --> 01:53:57,572
- Understood?
- Understood.

2283
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:07,515
Two
minutes to detonation.

2284
01:54:07,548 --> 01:54:09,517
Everybody down.

2285
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:10,518
Do not turn around

2286
01:54:10,551 --> 01:54:13,621
until you see light
reflected on the hills.

2287
01:54:13,655 --> 01:54:14,789
Then look at the explosion

2288
01:54:14,823 --> 01:54:16,457
only through your
welder's glass.

2289
01:54:16,491 --> 01:54:19,193
Ninety
seconds to detonation.

2290
01:54:20,829 --> 01:54:23,665
Ninety seconds to detonation.

2291
01:54:23,698 --> 01:54:25,800
Is it rubbed in?

2292
01:54:25,834 --> 01:54:27,201
Yeah.

2293
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:36,644
Sixty
seconds to detonation.

2294
01:54:51,325 --> 01:54:53,561
These things are
hard on your heart.

2295
01:54:53,594 --> 01:54:55,296
Thirty seconds.

2296
01:55:00,401 --> 01:55:01,803
Detonators charged.

2297
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:15,416
Seventeen, sixteen,

2298
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:16,617
fifteen,

2299
01:55:16,651 --> 01:55:17,820
fourteen,

2300
01:55:17,853 --> 01:55:19,654
thirteen,

2301
01:55:19,687 --> 01:55:21,857
twelve,

2302
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:23,558
eleven,

2303
01:55:23,591 --> 01:55:25,560
ten,

2304
01:55:25,593 --> 01:55:27,996
nine,

2305
01:55:28,030 --> 01:55:29,998
eight,

2306
01:55:30,032 --> 01:55:32,600
seven,

2307
01:55:32,633 --> 01:55:35,003
six...

2308
01:55:35,037 --> 01:55:36,504
five...

2309
01:55:38,506 --> 01:55:40,976
four...

2310
01:55:41,009 --> 01:55:42,945
three...

2311
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:44,512
two...

2312
01:55:45,814 --> 01:55:46,882
one.

2313
01:56:08,402 --> 01:56:10,338
Poof.

2314
01:57:19,141 --> 01:57:22,510
<i>"And now
I am become Death.</i>

2315
01:57:24,412 --> 01:57:26,581
<i>The destroyer of worlds."</i>

2316
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:00,949
It worked.

2317
01:58:36,184 --> 01:58:38,186
- You owe me ten dollars!
- Oh!

2318
01:58:40,521 --> 01:58:41,656
- Come on!
- Hang on.

2319
01:58:41,689 --> 01:58:43,125
I'm good for it, Kisty.

2320
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:45,459
You are.

2321
01:58:45,493 --> 01:58:48,196
Yes, you are!

2322
01:59:12,287 --> 01:59:13,822
Well done.

2323
01:59:15,523 --> 01:59:18,060
We did it! We did it!

2324
01:59:18,093 --> 01:59:19,995
Well done.

2325
01:59:24,799 --> 01:59:26,634
- Get me Potsdam right away.
- Yes, sir.

2326
01:59:38,113 --> 01:59:39,881
Get a message to Kitty.

2327
01:59:39,915 --> 01:59:40,614
We can't say anything.

2328
01:59:40,648 --> 01:59:42,583
Tell her to take in the sheets.

2329
01:59:50,591 --> 01:59:52,127
We did it, everyone!

2330
01:59:56,999 --> 01:59:58,799
Hello?

2331
01:59:58,834 --> 02:00:01,269
- Hi, Kitty?
- What, what? Charlotte...

2332
02:00:01,303 --> 02:00:02,670
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

2333
02:00:02,703 --> 02:00:04,072
Oh, um, well, I don't know,

2334
02:00:04,106 --> 02:00:07,309
he just said to tell you
to "bring in the sheets."

2335
02:00:10,012 --> 02:00:11,579
Kitty?

2336
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,117
Kitty? Kitty, are
you still there?

2337
02:00:22,024 --> 02:00:24,159
<i>If they detonate
it too high in the air,</i>

2338
02:00:24,192 --> 02:00:25,559
the blast won't be as powerful.

2339
02:00:25,593 --> 02:00:27,628
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2340
02:00:27,661 --> 02:00:29,697
we'll take it from here.

2341
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:42,844
Did Truman brief
Stalin at Potsdam?

2342
02:00:42,878 --> 02:00:45,613
A brief would be
an overstatement.

2343
02:00:45,646 --> 02:00:49,717
He referred to a
powerful new weapon.

2344
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:54,823
Stalin hoped we'd
use it against Japan.

2345
02:00:56,058 --> 02:00:57,792
That's it?

2346
02:00:57,826 --> 02:01:01,063
Robert, we've given them an ace,
it's for them to play the hand.

2347
02:01:03,198 --> 02:01:05,300
You're aiming for the 6th?

2348
02:01:05,333 --> 02:01:07,635
It's up to the CO
in the Pacific.

2349
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:11,039
Shall I come with
you to Washington?

2350
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:13,875
What for?

2351
02:01:16,144 --> 02:01:17,745
Well, you'll keep me informed.

2352
02:01:19,081 --> 02:01:20,714
Of course.

2353
02:01:22,284 --> 02:01:23,885
As best I can.

2354
02:01:41,303 --> 02:01:44,172
Would the Japanese surrender
if they knew what was coming?

2355
02:01:45,407 --> 02:01:47,008
I don't know.

2356
02:01:49,411 --> 02:01:51,413
Have you seen
Szilard's petition?

2357
02:01:51,446 --> 02:01:54,182
What the hell does Szilard
know about the Japanese?

2358
02:01:54,216 --> 02:01:55,426
You're not signing it, are you?

2359
02:01:55,450 --> 02:01:58,854
Many people have. A
lot of people have.

2360
02:01:58,887 --> 02:02:00,021
Edward.

2361
02:02:01,289 --> 02:02:02,958
The fact that we built this bomb

2362
02:02:02,991 --> 02:02:05,994
does not give us any more...
any more right or responsibility

2363
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:08,130
to decide how it's
used than anyone else.

2364
02:02:08,163 --> 02:02:10,165
But we're the only
people who know about it.

2365
02:02:10,198 --> 02:02:13,767
I've told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.

2366
02:02:13,801 --> 02:02:15,203
But what's your opinion?

2367
02:02:16,438 --> 02:02:17,973
Once it's used...

2368
02:02:19,074 --> 02:02:22,776
nuclear war, perhaps all war...

2369
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:25,814
becomes unthinkable.

2370
02:02:25,847 --> 02:02:28,850
Until somebody
builds a bigger bomb.

2371
02:02:49,437 --> 02:02:51,173
I thought they would call.

2372
02:02:51,206 --> 02:02:52,773
It's only the 5th.

2373
02:02:54,943 --> 02:02:56,945
In Japan, it's the 6th.

2374
02:03:10,091 --> 02:03:11,092
Charlotte.

2375
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:15,130
Try Groves.

2376
02:03:16,131 --> 02:03:17,199
<i>Anything?</i>

2377
02:03:19,501 --> 02:03:20,869
Charlotte?

2378
02:03:20,902 --> 02:03:22,204
Truman's
on the radio.

2379
02:03:23,138 --> 02:03:26,041
Sixteen hours ago,

2380
02:03:26,074 --> 02:03:31,980
an American airplane dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima...

2381
02:03:33,014 --> 02:03:36,151
and destroyed its
usefulness to the enemy.

2382
02:03:38,119 --> 02:03:43,992
The bomb had more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2383
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,929
It is an atomic bomb.

2384
02:03:51,132 --> 02:03:52,500
It is a harnessing

2385
02:03:52,534 --> 02:03:55,303
of the basic powers
of the universe.

2386
02:03:57,339 --> 02:03:58,974
<i>Groves on one.</i>

2387
02:03:59,007 --> 02:04:02,043
We are now prepared
to destroy more rapidly

2388
02:04:02,077 --> 02:04:04,379
and completely the Japanese...

2389
02:04:04,412 --> 02:04:06,081
General?

2390
02:04:06,114 --> 02:04:09,150
I'm very proud of
you and all of your people.

2391
02:04:09,184 --> 02:04:10,518
It went all right?

2392
02:04:10,552 --> 02:04:13,521
Apparently, it went
with a tremendous bang.

2393
02:04:13,555 --> 02:04:15,190
Well,

2394
02:04:15,223 --> 02:04:18,159
everyone here is feeling
reasonably good about it.

2395
02:04:19,594 --> 02:04:21,229
It's been a long road.

2396
02:04:21,263 --> 02:04:24,065
I think one of the
wisest things I ever did

2397
02:04:24,099 --> 02:04:27,135
was when I selected the
director of Los Alamos.

2398
02:04:29,504 --> 02:04:31,840
<i>We have spent</i>

2399
02:04:31,873 --> 02:04:33,875
<i>more than $2 billion</i>

2400
02:04:33,908 --> 02:04:38,146
<i>on the greatest scientific
gamble in history,</i>

2401
02:04:38,179 --> 02:04:41,016
<i>and we have won.</i>

2402
02:04:44,552 --> 02:04:47,255
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2403
02:04:47,289 --> 02:04:49,291
Oppie! Oppie!

2404
02:04:49,324 --> 02:04:52,527
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2405
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,396
Oppie! Oppie!

2406
02:04:54,429 --> 02:04:57,198
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2407
02:04:57,232 --> 02:05:00,568
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2408
02:05:00,602 --> 02:05:05,206
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2409
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:06,574
Oppie! Oppie!

2410
02:05:06,608 --> 02:05:09,177
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2411
02:06:08,269 --> 02:06:09,371
The world...

2412
02:06:11,373 --> 02:06:12,507
will remember this day.

2413
02:06:31,426 --> 02:06:33,161
It's too soon to...

2414
02:06:34,028 --> 02:06:35,697
It's too soon to determine

2415
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:38,099
what the results
of the bombing are.

2416
02:06:41,035 --> 02:06:42,637
But I'll bet the
Japanese didn't like it.

2417
02:07:03,525 --> 02:07:05,059
I'm so proud.

2418
02:07:06,194 --> 02:07:08,329
So proud of what you
have accomplished.

2419
02:07:14,636 --> 02:07:18,473
I just wish we had it in time
to use against the Germans.

2420
02:09:08,316 --> 02:09:10,184
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2421
02:09:10,785 --> 02:09:13,087
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2422
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:14,789
- Nice picture.
- Oh.

2423
02:09:14,823 --> 02:09:17,158
President Truman
will see you now.

2424
02:09:30,873 --> 02:09:33,708
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

2425
02:09:33,741 --> 02:09:35,677
- Mr. President.
- Please.

2426
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:37,512
Thank you.

2427
02:09:37,545 --> 02:09:39,080
Secretary Byrnes.

2428
02:09:40,281 --> 02:09:42,283
How's it feel to be

2429
02:09:42,317 --> 02:09:44,352
the most famous
man in the world?

2430
02:09:45,353 --> 02:09:48,423
You helped save a lot
of American lives.

2431
02:09:48,456 --> 02:09:50,826
What we did at
Hiroshima was a...

2432
02:09:50,859 --> 02:09:52,794
And Nagasaki.

2433
02:09:52,828 --> 02:09:54,830
Well, obviously.

2434
02:09:54,863 --> 02:09:58,800
Your invention let us
bring our boys home.

2435
02:09:58,834 --> 02:10:02,203
Well, it was hardly
my invention.

2436
02:10:02,236 --> 02:10:04,505
It was you on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

2437
02:10:07,375 --> 02:10:08,911
Jim tells me you're concerned

2438
02:10:08,944 --> 02:10:10,712
about an arms race
with the Soviets.

2439
02:10:10,745 --> 02:10:13,114
Uh, yes, uh...

2440
02:10:13,816 --> 02:10:15,316
Well, um,

2441
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:20,455
it's that, uh, now is
our chance to secure

2442
02:10:20,488 --> 02:10:23,358
international cooperation on
atomic energy,

2443
02:10:23,391 --> 02:10:26,427
and... and I'm concerned...

2444
02:10:26,461 --> 02:10:28,696
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

2445
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:30,665
I don't think I could give a...

2446
02:10:30,698 --> 02:10:32,101
Never.

2447
02:10:32,734 --> 02:10:34,369
Never.

2448
02:10:34,402 --> 02:10:37,572
Mr. President, the-the
Russians have good physicists

2449
02:10:37,605 --> 02:10:39,240
and-and... and
abundant resources.

2450
02:10:39,273 --> 02:10:41,376
- Abundant?
- Yes.

2451
02:10:41,409 --> 02:10:44,679
I don't think so.

2452
02:10:44,712 --> 02:10:48,249
Well, they'll-they'll put
everything they have and...

2453
02:10:51,519 --> 02:10:55,390
I hear you're
leaving Los Alamos.

2454
02:10:56,658 --> 02:10:57,759
What should we do with it?

2455
02:10:57,792 --> 02:11:00,294
Give it back to the Indians.

2456
02:11:07,702 --> 02:11:10,939
Um... Dr. Oppenheimer,

2457
02:11:10,973 --> 02:11:13,307
if what you say about
the Soviets is true,

2458
02:11:13,341 --> 02:11:16,744
we have to build up Los Alamos,

2459
02:11:16,778 --> 02:11:18,680
not shut it down.

2460
02:11:21,917 --> 02:11:23,718
Uh, Mr. President...

2461
02:11:24,786 --> 02:11:26,287
Um...

2462
02:11:28,957 --> 02:11:32,627
I feel that I have
blood on my hands.

2463
02:11:52,413 --> 02:11:57,719
You think anyone in
Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2464
02:11:57,752 --> 02:12:00,788
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2465
02:12:03,959 --> 02:12:06,327
They care who dropped it.

2466
02:12:07,029 --> 02:12:09,297
I did.

2467
02:12:10,531 --> 02:12:13,501
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2468
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:21,776
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2469
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:35,523
Don't let that
crybaby back in here.

2470
02:12:40,628 --> 02:12:43,664
<i>Robert saw that
hand-wringing got him nowhere.</i>

2471
02:12:43,698 --> 02:12:47,035
<i>By the time I'd met
him, he'd fully embraced</i>

2472
02:12:47,069 --> 02:12:49,637
<i>his "father of the
bomb" reputation.</i>

2473
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:52,074
Used his profile to
influence policy.

2474
02:13:01,549 --> 02:13:02,927
<i>Doctor, in the
years following the war,</i>

2475
02:13:02,951 --> 02:13:05,087
would you say that you
exerted a great influence

2476
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:06,922
on the atomic
policies of the USA?

2477
02:13:06,955 --> 02:13:09,657
<i>I think great
would be an overstatement.</i>

2478
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:11,659
Really? If we look
at the issue of isotopes,

2479
02:13:11,692 --> 02:13:13,394
were you not
personally responsible

2480
02:13:13,427 --> 02:13:15,463
for destroying all
opposition to their export?

2481
02:13:15,496 --> 02:13:18,366
Could use a-a bottle of beer...

2482
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:20,078
when making atomic
weapons. In fact, you do.

2483
02:13:20,102 --> 02:13:22,570
I was the spokesman,
but the-the opinion

2484
02:13:22,603 --> 02:13:24,405
among scientists was unanimous.

2485
02:13:24,438 --> 02:13:26,108
All along with
McCarthy on the rise,

2486
02:13:26,141 --> 02:13:27,542
he knew he was vulnerable.

2487
02:13:27,575 --> 02:13:28,944
His brother was blacklisted

2488
02:13:28,977 --> 02:13:31,880
by every university
in the country.

2489
02:13:32,981 --> 02:13:35,818
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

2490
02:13:38,419 --> 02:13:39,855
And Chevalier went into exile.

2491
02:13:42,991 --> 02:13:44,425
But none of that

2492
02:13:44,458 --> 02:13:46,427
stopped Robert from
pushing the GAC

2493
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:49,330
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

2494
02:13:51,133 --> 02:13:52,600
He was devastated

2495
02:13:52,633 --> 02:13:54,702
when Truman rejected
their recommendation.

2496
02:13:56,437 --> 02:13:58,974
I miss Richard more
than I can bear.

2497
02:13:59,007 --> 02:14:00,775
I know, Ruth, I know.

2498
02:14:00,809 --> 02:14:03,912
Part of me's glad he didn't live
to see where this is all going.

2499
02:14:06,681 --> 02:14:08,116
Here comes
the birthday boy.

2500
02:14:08,150 --> 02:14:10,751
- To gloat.
- Have fun.

2501
02:14:11,752 --> 02:14:14,122
Robert, uh, my son and his
fiancée are desperate to meet

2502
02:14:14,156 --> 02:14:16,124
the father of the
atomic bomb, and so...

2503
02:14:16,158 --> 02:14:18,961
Well. Good day.

2504
02:14:25,033 --> 02:14:27,135
Is this a bad time?

2505
02:14:27,169 --> 02:14:28,669
What do you think, Lewis?

2506
02:14:28,703 --> 02:14:30,771
Well, I think it must
have been a blow for you.

2507
02:14:30,805 --> 02:14:32,941
For the world.

2508
02:14:32,975 --> 02:14:34,609
The world?

2509
02:14:34,642 --> 02:14:38,613
What does Fuchs mean to
the rest of the world?

2510
02:14:38,646 --> 02:14:40,048
Fuchs?

2511
02:14:40,082 --> 02:14:41,682
Klaus Fuchs?

2512
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:45,519
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2513
02:14:48,689 --> 02:14:50,558
Klaus Fuchs, the British
scientist that you put

2514
02:14:50,591 --> 02:14:53,628
onto the implosion
team at Los Alamos,

2515
02:14:53,661 --> 02:14:55,796
<i>turns out he was...</i>

2516
02:14:55,831 --> 02:14:59,101
he was spying for the
Soviets the whole time.

2517
02:14:59,134 --> 02:15:00,668
I'm sorry.

2518
02:15:05,841 --> 02:15:08,743
<i>After the truth
about Fuchs came out,</i>

2519
02:15:08,776 --> 02:15:10,879
the FBI stepped up
surveillance on him.

2520
02:15:10,913 --> 02:15:14,782
He knew his phone was tapped,
he was followed everywhere...

2521
02:15:16,151 --> 02:15:17,585
his trash picked through.

2522
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:23,058
But never stopped
speaking his mind.

2523
02:15:23,091 --> 02:15:25,760
A man of conviction.

2524
02:15:25,793 --> 02:15:28,629
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

2525
02:15:30,132 --> 02:15:33,567
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

2526
02:15:34,970 --> 02:15:36,004
He took it.

2527
02:15:36,038 --> 02:15:38,506
America and Russia

2528
02:15:38,539 --> 02:15:42,811
may be likened to two
scorpions in a bottle,

2529
02:15:42,844 --> 02:15:46,214
each capable of
killing the other

2530
02:15:46,248 --> 02:15:48,951
but only at the risk
of his own life.

2531
02:15:48,984 --> 02:15:51,752
Now, there are various
aspects of this policy...

2532
02:15:51,786 --> 02:15:53,788
<i>Lot of
scientists blame me,</i>

2533
02:15:53,822 --> 02:15:56,959
<i>but how was I supposed
to protect him?</i>

2534
02:15:56,992 --> 02:15:58,961
Too secret for discussion,

2535
02:15:58,994 --> 02:16:00,996
candor is the only remedy.

2536
02:16:01,029 --> 02:16:02,563
Officials in Washington

2537
02:16:02,596 --> 02:16:04,108
need to start leveling
with the American people.

2538
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:08,636
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

2539
02:16:08,669 --> 02:16:10,705
So he had to lose his
security clearance.

2540
02:16:10,738 --> 02:16:13,507
And with it, his credibility.

2541
02:16:13,541 --> 02:16:15,944
But how could they do it?

2542
02:16:15,978 --> 02:16:17,245
He was a war hero.

2543
02:16:17,279 --> 02:16:18,981
He'd already told
everyone about his past.

2544
02:16:19,014 --> 02:16:20,983
Borden dredged it all up.

2545
02:16:21,016 --> 02:16:24,252
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2546
02:16:24,286 --> 02:16:25,854
Could it have been Nichols?

2547
02:16:25,887 --> 02:16:28,190
No, I can't imagine
he'd do that.

2548
02:16:28,223 --> 02:16:30,258
But whoever did
unleashed a firestorm

2549
02:16:30,292 --> 02:16:32,294
that burned a path
from the White House

2550
02:16:32,327 --> 02:16:34,997
back to my desk at the AEC.

2551
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:36,865
You see them in there, right?

2552
02:16:36,898 --> 02:16:40,768
I've been working my
whole life to get here.

2553
02:16:40,801 --> 02:16:42,838
Cabinet of the United
States of America.

2554
02:16:42,871 --> 02:16:44,805
Now, in front of
the entire country,

2555
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:46,908
they're gonna put
me back in my place.

2556
02:16:48,343 --> 02:16:51,013
A lowly shoe salesman.

2557
02:16:51,046 --> 02:16:52,881
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2558
02:16:52,914 --> 02:16:54,983
I-I think we can get
the Senate to grasp

2559
02:16:55,017 --> 02:16:57,819
that you did your duty,
painful though it was.

2560
02:16:57,853 --> 02:16:59,620
Now, will Hill's
testimony back us up?

2561
02:16:59,653 --> 02:17:01,631
- Hill will be fine.
- I don't really know him,

2562
02:17:01,655 --> 02:17:03,825
but, uh, he was one of
Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2563
02:17:03,859 --> 02:17:05,894
and they never forgave
Robert for not supporting

2564
02:17:05,927 --> 02:17:08,330
their petition
against bombing Japan.

2565
02:17:08,363 --> 02:17:13,567
This was taken 31 days
after the bombing.

2566
02:17:13,601 --> 02:17:16,338
Virtually everyone
in the street,

2567
02:17:16,371 --> 02:17:18,606
for nearly a mile around,

2568
02:17:18,639 --> 02:17:21,843
was instantly and
seriously burned.

2569
02:17:23,078 --> 02:17:27,615
The, uh, Japanese spoke of
people who wore striped clothing

2570
02:17:27,648 --> 02:17:30,618
upon whom the skin
was burned in stripes.

2571
02:17:31,685 --> 02:17:34,056
There were many who
thought themselves lucky,

2572
02:17:34,089 --> 02:17:36,791
who climbed out of the
ruins of their homes

2573
02:17:36,825 --> 02:17:38,692
only slightly injured.

2574
02:17:39,828 --> 02:17:41,595
But they died anyway.

2575
02:17:42,264 --> 02:17:45,367
They died days or weeks later

2576
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:48,736
from the radium-like rays
emitted in great numbers

2577
02:17:48,769 --> 02:17:50,671
at the moment of the explosion.

2578
02:17:51,873 --> 02:17:53,942
Did you read this
crap in the papers?

2579
02:17:53,975 --> 02:17:56,777
A British physicist is
saying the atomic bombings

2580
02:17:56,812 --> 02:17:58,980
were not the last
act of World War II

2581
02:17:59,014 --> 02:18:02,150
but the first act of this
cold war with Russia.

2582
02:18:02,184 --> 02:18:03,651
Which physicist?

2583
02:18:03,684 --> 02:18:05,087
I think you knew him.

2584
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:06,720
Patrick Blackett.

2585
02:18:09,191 --> 02:18:10,758
He may not be wrong.

2586
02:18:10,791 --> 02:18:12,127
Stimson is now telling me

2587
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:15,397
we bombed an enemy that
was essentially defeated.

2588
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:18,967
Robert, you've
all the influence now.

2589
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,701
Please.

2590
02:18:20,734 --> 02:18:22,838
Urge them to continue my
research on the Super.

2591
02:18:22,871 --> 02:18:24,239
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2592
02:18:24,272 --> 02:18:26,374
Why not?

2593
02:18:26,408 --> 02:18:28,110
It's not the right
use of our resources.

2594
02:18:28,143 --> 02:18:30,245
Is that what you really believe?

2595
02:18:30,278 --> 02:18:32,646
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2596
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:35,083
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2597
02:18:36,384 --> 02:18:38,153
Nobody knows what you believe.

2598
02:18:39,254 --> 02:18:41,123
Do you? Hmm?

2599
02:18:41,156 --> 02:18:43,859
<i>One final time,
our program director,</i>

2600
02:18:43,892 --> 02:18:45,861
<i>Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

2601
02:18:47,062 --> 02:18:48,830
<i>I hope that
in years to come</i>

2602
02:18:48,864 --> 02:18:52,868
you will look back on
your work here with pride.

2603
02:18:52,901 --> 02:18:55,270
But today, that pride
must be tempered

2604
02:18:55,303 --> 02:18:57,638
with a profound concern.

2605
02:18:58,907 --> 02:19:00,708
If atomic weapons
are to be added

2606
02:19:00,741 --> 02:19:03,145
to the arsenals of
a warring world,

2607
02:19:03,178 --> 02:19:06,747
then the day will come
when people will curse

2608
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:08,183
the name of Los Alamos.

2609
02:19:12,187 --> 02:19:14,289
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

2610
02:19:14,322 --> 02:19:16,324
Stopped off to get this.

2611
02:19:16,358 --> 02:19:19,161
It seems pretty favorable.

2612
02:19:19,194 --> 02:19:20,304
There's Oppenheimer.

2613
02:19:20,328 --> 02:19:21,897
What's the caption?

2614
02:19:21,930 --> 02:19:24,765
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought..."

2615
02:19:26,334 --> 02:19:27,903
"and the US won."

2616
02:19:28,736 --> 02:19:30,005
That'll work.

2617
02:19:30,038 --> 02:19:32,274
Those were your words
from the other day.

2618
02:19:32,307 --> 02:19:33,707
We needed to pivot.

2619
02:19:33,741 --> 02:19:35,010
But how would you know

2620
02:19:35,043 --> 02:19:36,845
what <i>Time</i> magazine's
gonna write?

2621
02:19:36,878 --> 02:19:39,114
Henry Luce is a friend.

2622
02:19:45,253 --> 02:19:48,756
You sat here and let me
tell you how it's done,

2623
02:19:48,789 --> 02:19:51,459
but you've been far
ahead all along.

2624
02:19:51,493 --> 02:19:54,462
Survival in Washington

2625
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:56,831
is about knowing how
to get things done.

2626
02:19:57,465 --> 02:19:58,867
Right.

2627
02:20:00,468 --> 02:20:02,204
What was it you
said about Borden?

2628
02:20:02,237 --> 02:20:05,240
"Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?"

2629
02:20:07,075 --> 02:20:10,078
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

2630
02:20:12,147 --> 02:20:14,382
It's gonna come down
to how much influence

2631
02:20:14,416 --> 02:20:16,484
Borden's been able
to exert on Teller.

2632
02:20:16,518 --> 02:20:18,954
Did I say something funny?

2633
02:20:18,987 --> 02:20:20,355
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"

2634
02:20:20,388 --> 02:20:24,159
when we all know
that it's Strauss.

2635
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:26,161
Lewis brought me to
Princeton, Kitty.

2636
02:20:26,194 --> 02:20:28,897
And then you humiliated
him in front of Congress.

2637
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:31,765
But more useful than a sandwich.

2638
02:20:34,936 --> 02:20:36,113
- How'd I do?
- I'll call recess,

2639
02:20:36,137 --> 02:20:37,239
ten minutes.

2640
02:20:37,272 --> 02:20:39,507
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2641
02:20:39,541 --> 02:20:40,774
That was six years ago.

2642
02:20:40,809 --> 02:20:42,510
You know, the truly vindictive,

2643
02:20:42,544 --> 02:20:44,145
patient as saints.

2644
02:20:44,179 --> 02:20:46,982
Strauss has been perfectly
clear that he is neutral.

2645
02:20:47,015 --> 02:20:50,518
Wake up. It is Strauss.

2646
02:20:50,552 --> 02:20:53,488
It's always been
Strauss, and you know it.

2647
02:20:53,521 --> 02:20:55,156
Why won't you fight him?

2648
02:20:56,191 --> 02:20:57,392
Christ's sake.

2649
02:20:58,493 --> 02:21:01,162
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover

2650
02:21:01,196 --> 02:21:02,864
or one of Truman's
guys. It was you.

2651
02:21:02,897 --> 02:21:04,866
You gave the file to Borden.

2652
02:21:04,899 --> 02:21:06,534
You set him on Oppenheimer.

2653
02:21:06,568 --> 02:21:09,004
- You convinced him to...
- Borden...

2654
02:21:09,037 --> 02:21:10,939
Didn't
take any convincing.

2655
02:21:10,972 --> 02:21:13,074
Take your time,
use the entire file.

2656
02:21:13,108 --> 02:21:16,011
Write up your conclusion,
send them to the FBI.

2657
02:21:16,044 --> 02:21:18,280
The material is
obviously extensive,

2658
02:21:18,313 --> 02:21:20,982
but there's nothing new here.

2659
02:21:21,016 --> 02:21:22,550
Your
conclusions will be.

2660
02:21:22,584 --> 02:21:24,886
And they'll have to be answered.

2661
02:21:24,919 --> 02:21:26,388
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2662
02:21:26,421 --> 02:21:30,025
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

2663
02:21:30,058 --> 02:21:32,927
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2664
02:21:32,961 --> 02:21:34,562
while you do this with the AEC.

2665
02:21:34,596 --> 02:21:36,431
- A trial.
- No.

2666
02:21:36,464 --> 02:21:40,235
No trial. You can't give
Oppenheimer a platform.

2667
02:21:40,268 --> 02:21:42,037
You can't martyr him.

2668
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:45,240
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

2669
02:21:45,273 --> 02:21:48,843
so he can never again speak on
matters of national security.

2670
02:21:48,877 --> 02:21:50,945
Then what?

2671
02:21:52,147 --> 02:21:55,517
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

2672
02:22:01,956 --> 02:22:03,234
<i>A simple
bureaucratic procedure.</i>

2673
02:22:03,258 --> 02:22:05,894
His Q clearance
is up for renewal.

2674
02:22:05,927 --> 02:22:08,897
You send your
accusations to the FBI.

2675
02:22:10,532 --> 02:22:14,135
Hoover sends them to the
AEC, you're forced to act.

2676
02:22:14,969 --> 02:22:16,271
You write up an indictment

2677
02:22:16,304 --> 02:22:17,939
<i>and tell Oppenheimer</i>

2678
02:22:17,972 --> 02:22:20,642
<i>his security clearance
is not being renewed.</i>

2679
02:22:20,675 --> 02:22:22,210
<i>But offer him the
chance to appeal.</i>

2680
02:22:22,243 --> 02:22:24,579
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

2681
02:22:24,612 --> 02:22:26,114
May I keep this?

2682
02:22:26,147 --> 02:22:27,082
No.

2683
02:22:27,115 --> 02:22:29,351
If you do decide to appeal,

2684
02:22:29,384 --> 02:22:30,919
they'll have to send you a copy.

2685
02:22:30,952 --> 02:22:34,189
When he appeals... and
trust me, he will...

2686
02:22:34,222 --> 02:22:36,624
I appoint a board.

2687
02:22:36,658 --> 02:22:39,127
They will, of
course, have counsel.

2688
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:41,096
- Prosecutor?
- In all but name.

2689
02:22:41,129 --> 02:22:43,298
- Who?
- Roger Robb.

2690
02:22:43,331 --> 02:22:44,499
Ouch.

2691
02:22:44,532 --> 02:22:46,000
Robb will have
security clearance

2692
02:22:46,034 --> 02:22:47,569
<i>to examine Oppenheimer's file.</i>

2693
02:22:47,602 --> 02:22:49,037
<i>As will the Gray board.</i>

2694
02:22:49,070 --> 02:22:50,438
Defense counsel will not.

2695
02:22:52,273 --> 02:22:53,675
A closed hearing.

2696
02:22:53,708 --> 02:22:54,952
<i>The so-called
derogatory information</i>

2697
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:57,145
in your indictment of me.

2698
02:22:57,178 --> 02:22:59,647
No audience. No reporters.

2699
02:22:59,681 --> 02:23:03,151
- No burden of proof.
- No burden of proof?

2700
02:23:04,519 --> 02:23:06,020
We're not convicting.

2701
02:23:06,721 --> 02:23:09,324
We're just denying.

2702
02:23:14,295 --> 02:23:17,065
What is it you said?

2703
02:23:17,098 --> 02:23:20,435
"This is just how
the game is played."

2704
02:23:20,468 --> 02:23:23,438
Well, forgive my naivete.

2705
02:23:23,471 --> 02:23:25,440
Amateurs seek the sun.

2706
02:23:26,408 --> 02:23:27,475
Get eaten.

2707
02:23:28,543 --> 02:23:31,379
Power stays in the shadows.

2708
02:23:31,413 --> 02:23:35,116
But, sir, you're... you're
out of the shadows now.

2709
02:23:35,150 --> 02:23:36,584
Yeah, that's why
this has to work.

2710
02:23:36,618 --> 02:23:38,086
Well...

2711
02:23:39,387 --> 02:23:41,523
Teller's testifying
this morning.

2712
02:23:41,556 --> 02:23:43,958
That'll help. And then...

2713
02:23:43,992 --> 02:23:45,427
Hill is in the afternoon.

2714
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:47,929
Hill is gonna help us too.

2715
02:23:50,165 --> 02:23:53,334
As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

2716
02:23:53,368 --> 02:23:54,402
May I keep this?

2717
02:23:54,436 --> 02:23:55,470
No.

2718
02:23:57,572 --> 02:23:59,574
If you do decide to appeal,

2719
02:23:59,607 --> 02:24:02,444
then they'll have
to send you a copy.

2720
02:24:06,014 --> 02:24:08,316
Take my car and
driver. I insist.

2721
02:24:13,054 --> 02:24:14,989
I'll have to consult
my lawyers, Lewis.

2722
02:24:15,023 --> 02:24:17,725
Of course. But
don't take too long.

2723
02:24:17,759 --> 02:24:19,961
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2724
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:28,403
I'm sorry it's come
to this, Robert.

2725
02:24:28,436 --> 02:24:29,471
I think it's wrong.

2726
02:24:42,784 --> 02:24:44,219
<i>Nichols
wants me to fight</i>

2727
02:24:44,252 --> 02:24:46,254
<i>so he can get it
all on the record.</i>

2728
02:24:46,287 --> 02:24:48,156
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2729
02:24:48,189 --> 02:24:51,025
Strauss knows that
you can't do that,

2730
02:24:51,059 --> 02:24:53,495
you'd be accepting the charges.

2731
02:24:53,528 --> 02:24:55,196
You'll lose your job.

2732
02:24:55,230 --> 02:24:57,499
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

2733
02:24:57,532 --> 02:25:00,235
Robert, we have to fight.

2734
02:25:02,804 --> 02:25:05,106
As AEC Counsel,
I can't represent you.

2735
02:25:05,139 --> 02:25:06,674
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2736
02:25:06,708 --> 02:25:08,243
Oh, he's good.

2737
02:25:08,276 --> 02:25:12,013
The best, but I
have to warn you...

2738
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:15,116
this won't be a fair fight.

2739
02:25:15,149 --> 02:25:17,161
<i>During your interview</i>

2740
02:25:17,185 --> 02:25:19,654
with Boris Pash in 1943,
did you refer to microfilm?

2741
02:25:19,687 --> 02:25:21,189
- No.
- Tab 11,

2742
02:25:21,222 --> 02:25:22,666
page one, paragraph
three. You never said,

2743
02:25:22,690 --> 02:25:26,327
"Man at the consulate expert
in the use of microfilm"?

2744
02:25:26,361 --> 02:25:27,695
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No.

2745
02:25:27,729 --> 02:25:28,663
I would like to
know what document

2746
02:25:28,696 --> 02:25:30,131
Mr. Robb is quoting from

2747
02:25:30,164 --> 02:25:31,442
and if we might be
furnished with a copy.

2748
02:25:31,466 --> 02:25:33,535
The document is
classified, Mr. Garrison.

2749
02:25:33,568 --> 02:25:35,412
I think we should get back
to first-hand information.

2750
02:25:35,436 --> 02:25:36,804
This is first-hand.

2751
02:25:36,839 --> 02:25:39,107
How so, Roger?

2752
02:25:40,475 --> 02:25:42,310
There was a recording
of the interview.

2753
02:25:46,281 --> 02:25:48,182
You let
my client sit here

2754
02:25:48,216 --> 02:25:49,717
and potentially perjure himself,

2755
02:25:49,751 --> 02:25:52,287
and all this time,
you had a recording?

2756
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:53,688
Nobody told your client

2757
02:25:53,721 --> 02:25:55,123
to misrepresent
his former answers.

2758
02:25:55,156 --> 02:25:57,225
Misrepre... It-it
was 12 years ago.

2759
02:25:57,258 --> 02:25:58,560
Can we hear this recording?

2760
02:25:58,593 --> 02:26:00,170
You don't have the
clearance, Mr. Garrison.

2761
02:26:00,194 --> 02:26:01,830
But you're reading
it into the record.

2762
02:26:01,864 --> 02:26:03,498
Please, please.

2763
02:26:03,531 --> 02:26:07,135
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

2764
02:26:07,168 --> 02:26:09,604
If it's truth, where's
the disclosure?

2765
02:26:09,637 --> 02:26:11,272
Where's the witness list?

2766
02:26:11,306 --> 02:26:13,842
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a
trial, as you are well aware.

2767
02:26:13,876 --> 02:26:15,743
Evidentiary rules do not apply.

2768
02:26:15,777 --> 02:26:17,645
We are dealing with
national security.

2769
02:26:17,679 --> 02:26:19,180
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2770
02:26:19,213 --> 02:26:21,583
I fail to see how
national security

2771
02:26:21,616 --> 02:26:23,318
prevents the prosecution
from providing us

2772
02:26:23,351 --> 02:26:25,362
- with a list of witnesses.
- Perhaps we are in need

2773
02:26:25,386 --> 02:26:26,697
- of a brief recess.
- Gentlemen,

2774
02:26:26,721 --> 02:26:28,456
you have my words.

2775
02:26:28,489 --> 02:26:30,634
If you say they're from a
transcript, then I'll accept it.

2776
02:26:30,658 --> 02:26:33,428
I've already explained I made
up a cock-and-bull story.

2777
02:26:33,461 --> 02:26:36,798
But why would anyone make
up such an elaborate story?

2778
02:26:36,832 --> 02:26:38,901
Because I was an idiot.

2779
02:26:38,934 --> 02:26:40,535
Why lie?

2780
02:26:40,568 --> 02:26:43,171
Well, clearly with the
intention of not revealing

2781
02:26:43,204 --> 02:26:45,273
who the intermediary was.

2782
02:26:45,306 --> 02:26:47,342
Your friend, Haakon
Chevalier, the Communist.

2783
02:26:47,375 --> 02:26:49,644
Is he still your friend?

2784
02:26:49,677 --> 02:26:51,112
Yes.

2785
02:26:53,214 --> 02:26:56,150
Dr. Rabi,
thank you for coming.

2786
02:26:56,184 --> 02:26:57,896
Do you know who else the
prosecution has called?

2787
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:00,254
Teller, obviously.

2788
02:27:01,222 --> 02:27:02,490
They've asked Lawrence.

2789
02:27:02,523 --> 02:27:03,358
What did he say?

2790
02:27:03,391 --> 02:27:06,294
He wasn't going to
help them, but...

2791
02:27:06,327 --> 02:27:07,261
But?

2792
02:27:07,295 --> 02:27:09,297
Strauss told him that
you and Ruth Tolman

2793
02:27:09,330 --> 02:27:11,766
<i>have been having an
affair for years.</i>

2794
02:27:11,799 --> 02:27:12,901
<i>The whole time you lived</i>

2795
02:27:12,935 --> 02:27:14,569
with them in Pasadena.

2796
02:27:14,602 --> 02:27:16,270
He convinced Lawrence

2797
02:27:16,304 --> 02:27:17,873
that Richard died
of a broken heart.

2798
02:27:17,906 --> 02:27:19,207
That's absurd.

2799
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:21,776
- What part?
- The broken heart.

2800
02:27:21,810 --> 02:27:23,846
Richard never found out.

2801
02:27:23,879 --> 02:27:25,647
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2802
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,181
I don't know.

2803
02:27:27,715 --> 02:27:29,350
Dr. Rabi,

2804
02:27:29,384 --> 02:27:32,453
what governmental positions
do you currently hold?

2805
02:27:32,487 --> 02:27:35,390
I am the chairman of the
General Advisory Committee

2806
02:27:35,423 --> 02:27:38,326
to the AEC, succeeding
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2807
02:27:38,359 --> 02:27:41,195
And how long have
you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

2808
02:27:41,229 --> 02:27:42,831
Since 1928.

2809
02:27:42,865 --> 02:27:44,933
I... I know him quite well.

2810
02:27:44,967 --> 02:27:46,935
Well enough to
speak to the bearing

2811
02:27:46,969 --> 02:27:49,537
of his loyalty and character?

2812
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:53,574
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

2813
02:27:53,608 --> 02:27:56,277
And he is loyal to
the United States,

2814
02:27:56,310 --> 02:27:57,545
to his friends,

2815
02:27:57,578 --> 02:28:00,248
to the institutions
of which he is part.

2816
02:28:01,716 --> 02:28:02,750
Eat.

2817
02:28:21,736 --> 02:28:23,438
What was that?

2818
02:28:23,471 --> 02:28:25,506
Nothing to worry about.

2819
02:28:27,742 --> 02:28:29,477
<i>After the
Russian A-bomb test,</i>

2820
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:31,980
did Dr. Lawrence come to see
you about the hydrogen bomb?

2821
02:28:32,014 --> 02:28:33,816
You'd be better off asking him.

2822
02:28:33,849 --> 02:28:35,383
Well, I fully intend to.

2823
02:28:35,416 --> 02:28:37,986
Would you say that
Dr. Oppenheimer was

2824
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:40,022
unalterably opposed
to the H-bomb?

2825
02:28:40,055 --> 02:28:42,858
No, he-he thought
that a fusion program

2826
02:28:42,891 --> 02:28:45,994
would come at the expense of our
awfully good fission program.

2827
02:28:46,028 --> 02:28:47,863
But that proved
not to be the case.

2828
02:28:47,896 --> 02:28:50,531
In the event both could be done.

2829
02:28:50,565 --> 02:28:52,868
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied

2830
02:28:52,901 --> 02:28:54,036
that in his testimony here,

2831
02:28:54,069 --> 02:28:56,337
Dr. Oppenheimer had
been wholly truthful.

2832
02:28:56,370 --> 02:28:59,574
What would you say whether
or not he should be cleared?

2833
02:28:59,607 --> 02:29:01,509
Why go through all
this against a man

2834
02:29:01,542 --> 02:29:03,745
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2835
02:29:03,778 --> 02:29:05,413
Look at his record.

2836
02:29:05,446 --> 02:29:07,515
We have an A-bomb and
a whole series of it.

2837
02:29:07,548 --> 02:29:09,484
We have a whole
series of Super bombs.

2838
02:29:09,517 --> 02:29:11,486
What more do you want?

2839
02:29:11,519 --> 02:29:12,386
Mermaids?

2840
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:14,722
But I've known
Secretary Strauss

2841
02:29:14,756 --> 02:29:16,357
for many years,

2842
02:29:16,390 --> 02:29:19,660
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

2843
02:29:19,694 --> 02:29:22,363
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

2844
02:29:22,396 --> 02:29:23,631
We'll break now,

2845
02:29:23,664 --> 02:29:25,466
unless there's any
immediate business.

2846
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:28,036
Senator, I'd
like to once again request

2847
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:30,738
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

2848
02:29:30,772 --> 02:29:33,541
And I will remind the
nominee that we don't always

2849
02:29:33,574 --> 02:29:35,576
have that information
in advance.

2850
02:29:35,610 --> 02:29:39,047
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

2851
02:29:39,081 --> 02:29:40,715
Mr. Chairman, our next
scheduled witness,

2852
02:29:40,748 --> 02:29:45,286
Dr. Lawrence, has apparently
come down with colitis.

2853
02:29:46,754 --> 02:29:49,657
So we'll proceed with
William Borden instead.

2854
02:29:50,926 --> 02:29:52,326
Mr. Borden, welcome.

2855
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:53,829
Please take a seat.

2856
02:29:54,997 --> 02:29:57,398
Mr. Borden,

2857
02:29:57,431 --> 02:30:00,002
during your investigation
into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2858
02:30:00,035 --> 02:30:01,669
did you reach
certain conclusions?

2859
02:30:01,702 --> 02:30:04,006
- I did.
- And did there come a time

2860
02:30:04,039 --> 02:30:05,506
when you expressed
those conclusions

2861
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:07,542
in a letter to
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

2862
02:30:07,575 --> 02:30:09,510
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation?

2863
02:30:09,544 --> 02:30:10,955
- That is correct.
- Prior to the writing

2864
02:30:10,979 --> 02:30:12,756
of the letter, did you discuss
the writing of the letter

2865
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:15,083
with anybody attached to the
Atomic Energy Commission?

2866
02:30:15,117 --> 02:30:16,717
I did not.

2867
02:30:16,751 --> 02:30:18,096
Thanks, and do you
have a copy of the letter?

2868
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:19,720
I have one
in front of me.

2869
02:30:19,754 --> 02:30:21,857
Would you please be so
kind as to read it, sir?

2870
02:30:21,890 --> 02:30:23,424
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2871
02:30:23,457 --> 02:30:24,903
the purpose of this
letter is to state..."

2872
02:30:24,927 --> 02:30:26,971
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, if I could have a...

2873
02:30:26,995 --> 02:30:29,363
What is the purpose
of the delay?

2874
02:30:29,397 --> 02:30:30,866
He's simply gonna
read the letter.

2875
02:30:30,899 --> 02:30:32,433
Mr. Chairman,

2876
02:30:32,466 --> 02:30:34,468
this is the first I've
seen of this letter,

2877
02:30:34,502 --> 02:30:35,770
and I see statements here, uh,

2878
02:30:35,803 --> 02:30:37,772
at least one, of a
kind that I don't think

2879
02:30:37,805 --> 02:30:39,774
anyone would like to
see go into the record.

2880
02:30:39,807 --> 02:30:42,577
These are accusations that
have not previously been made.

2881
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:44,545
That are not part of the
indictment from Nichols.

2882
02:30:44,579 --> 02:30:46,714
Accusations of a kind that
I don't think belong here.

2883
02:30:46,747 --> 02:30:48,917
The witness wrote this
letter on his own initiative,

2884
02:30:48,951 --> 02:30:51,519
laying out evidence that has
already been before the board.

2885
02:30:51,552 --> 02:30:53,155
His conclusions are
valid testimony,

2886
02:30:53,188 --> 02:30:55,090
just like the... the
positive conclusions

2887
02:30:55,123 --> 02:30:56,457
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2888
02:30:56,490 --> 02:30:57,993
It cuts both ways.

2889
02:30:58,026 --> 02:31:00,461
How long has Counsel been in
possession of this letter?

2890
02:31:00,494 --> 02:31:01,864
I don't think I
should be subject

2891
02:31:01,897 --> 02:31:04,465
to cross-examination
by you, Mr. Garrison.

2892
02:31:04,498 --> 02:31:06,144
Mr. Garrison, given
that we on the board

2893
02:31:06,168 --> 02:31:07,668
have all read the letter,

2894
02:31:07,702 --> 02:31:10,038
wouldn't it be better to
have it in the record?

2895
02:31:10,072 --> 02:31:11,539
Let's proceed.

2896
02:31:13,541 --> 02:31:15,010
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2897
02:31:15,043 --> 02:31:18,479
"the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

2898
02:31:18,512 --> 02:31:19,815
"based upon years of study

2899
02:31:19,848 --> 02:31:22,617
"of the available
classified evidence,

2900
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:24,685
"that more probably than not,

2901
02:31:24,719 --> 02:31:29,590
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is an
agent of the Soviet Union.

2902
02:31:29,624 --> 02:31:31,960
"The following
conclusions are justified.

2903
02:31:31,994 --> 02:31:36,832
"One, between 1929 and 1942,
more probably than not,

2904
02:31:36,865 --> 02:31:38,166
"J. Robert Oppenheimer

2905
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:40,501
"was a sufficiently
hardened Communist,

2906
02:31:40,534 --> 02:31:42,637
"that he volunteered
information to the Soviets.

2907
02:31:42,670 --> 02:31:45,007
"Two, more probably than not,

2908
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:49,610
"he has since been functioning
as an espionage agent.

2909
02:31:49,644 --> 02:31:52,480
"Three, more probably than not,

2910
02:31:52,513 --> 02:31:54,749
"he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

2911
02:31:54,782 --> 02:31:57,518
in influencing United
States military policy..."

2912
02:31:57,551 --> 02:31:58,786
I'm sorry, Robert.

2913
02:31:58,820 --> 02:32:00,164
"atomic
energy, intelligence

2914
02:32:00,188 --> 02:32:01,565
- and diplomatic policy."
- Is anyone

2915
02:32:01,589 --> 02:32:03,225
ever going to tell the truth

2916
02:32:03,258 --> 02:32:05,027
about what's happening here?

2917
02:32:05,060 --> 02:32:08,596
<i>We will
now hear from Dr. David Hill.</i>

2918
02:32:17,839 --> 02:32:19,174
Dr. Hill,

2919
02:32:19,207 --> 02:32:21,843
would you care to
make a statement?

2920
02:32:22,978 --> 02:32:24,545
Thank you.

2921
02:32:24,578 --> 02:32:28,250
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

2922
02:32:28,283 --> 02:32:30,685
A man who has given
years of service

2923
02:32:30,718 --> 02:32:33,688
in high positions of government

2924
02:32:33,721 --> 02:32:38,659
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

2925
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,172
The views I have to
express are my own,

2926
02:32:41,196 --> 02:32:44,900
but I believe that much I have
to say will help to indicate

2927
02:32:44,933 --> 02:32:48,636
why most of the
scientists in this country

2928
02:32:48,669 --> 02:32:51,672
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

2929
02:32:51,706 --> 02:32:53,541
completely out of government.

2930
02:32:55,576 --> 02:32:58,080
You're... You're
referring to the hostility

2931
02:32:58,113 --> 02:32:59,580
of certain scientists

2932
02:32:59,613 --> 02:33:01,249
directed toward Mr. Strauss

2933
02:33:01,283 --> 02:33:03,517
because of his
commitment to security

2934
02:33:03,551 --> 02:33:06,554
as demonstrated in the
Oppenheimer affair?

2935
02:33:09,024 --> 02:33:10,292
No.

2936
02:33:10,325 --> 02:33:12,727
Because of the
personal vindictiveness

2937
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:14,997
he demonstrated against
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2938
02:33:16,664 --> 02:33:18,799
Order.

2939
02:33:18,834 --> 02:33:19,868
Order!

2940
02:33:19,901 --> 02:33:25,173
It appears to most scientists
around this country

2941
02:33:25,207 --> 02:33:26,741
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being

2942
02:33:26,774 --> 02:33:29,011
pilloried and put
through an ordeal

2943
02:33:29,044 --> 02:33:32,147
because he expressed
his honest opinions.

2944
02:33:33,148 --> 02:33:35,217
Dr. Bush, I thought I
was performing a service

2945
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:36,985
to my country when
hearing this case.

2946
02:33:37,019 --> 02:33:41,156
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

2947
02:33:41,189 --> 02:33:43,825
because he expressed
strong opinions.

2948
02:33:43,859 --> 02:33:46,928
If you want to try that
case, you should try me.

2949
02:33:46,962 --> 02:33:50,966
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I become stirred,

2950
02:33:50,999 --> 02:33:52,200
but I am.

2951
02:33:52,234 --> 02:33:54,202
Dr. Hill, we've already heard

2952
02:33:54,236 --> 02:33:56,670
that Mr. Strauss did
not bring the charges

2953
02:33:56,704 --> 02:33:59,774
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2954
02:33:59,807 --> 02:34:02,310
The Oppenheimer matter was

2955
02:34:02,344 --> 02:34:04,712
initiated and carried through

2956
02:34:04,745 --> 02:34:07,115
largely through the
animus of Lewis Strauss.

2957
02:34:08,716 --> 02:34:11,353
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

2958
02:34:11,386 --> 02:34:12,988
on the shipment of
isotopes to Norway,

2959
02:34:13,021 --> 02:34:17,025
and Strauss never forgave
him this public humiliation.

2960
02:34:17,059 --> 02:34:19,660
Another controversy between
them centered around

2961
02:34:19,693 --> 02:34:22,663
their differences in
judgment on how the H-bomb

2962
02:34:22,696 --> 02:34:24,765
<i>would contribute to
national security.</i>

2963
02:34:24,799 --> 02:34:26,767
Strauss turned to the
personnel security system

2964
02:34:26,801 --> 02:34:31,039
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

2965
02:34:31,073 --> 02:34:33,607
and Strauss was able to
find a few ambitious men

2966
02:34:33,641 --> 02:34:36,677
who also disagreed with
Oppenheimer's positions

2967
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:39,747
and envied him his prestige
in government circles.

2968
02:34:39,780 --> 02:34:42,384
I've always
assumed, and still assume,

2969
02:34:42,417 --> 02:34:44,652
that he's loyal to
the United States.

2970
02:34:44,685 --> 02:34:46,097
I believe this. And
I shall believe it

2971
02:34:46,121 --> 02:34:48,689
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

2972
02:34:48,722 --> 02:34:50,691
Do you or do you not believe

2973
02:34:50,724 --> 02:34:53,028
that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?

2974
02:34:56,764 --> 02:34:58,033
In a great number of cases,

2975
02:34:58,066 --> 02:35:00,035
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way

2976
02:35:00,068 --> 02:35:03,939
which was to me exceedingly
hard to understand.

2977
02:35:03,972 --> 02:35:05,974
I thoroughly disagreed with
him in numerous issues,

2978
02:35:06,007 --> 02:35:08,110
and his actions
frankly appeared to me

2979
02:35:08,143 --> 02:35:09,677
confused and complicated.

2980
02:35:09,710 --> 02:35:11,246
To this extent, I feel,

2981
02:35:11,279 --> 02:35:14,382
I want to see the vital
interest of this country

2982
02:35:14,416 --> 02:35:16,251
in hands which I
understand better

2983
02:35:16,284 --> 02:35:18,420
and therefore trust more.

2984
02:35:18,453 --> 02:35:21,223
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

2985
02:35:25,026 --> 02:35:26,128
I'm sorry.

2986
02:35:28,762 --> 02:35:30,932
<i>You shook
his fucking hand?</i>

2987
02:35:30,966 --> 02:35:33,869
Oh, I would have
spit in his face.

2988
02:35:33,902 --> 02:35:35,446
Not sure the board would
have appreciated that.

2989
02:35:35,470 --> 02:35:37,048
Is it not
gentlemanly enough for you?

2990
02:35:37,072 --> 02:35:40,408
Well, I-I think you're all
being too goddamn gentlemanly.

2991
02:35:40,442 --> 02:35:42,410
Gray must see what
Robb is doing.

2992
02:35:42,444 --> 02:35:44,379
Why doesn't he
just shut him down?

2993
02:35:44,412 --> 02:35:47,015
And you shaking Teller's hand.

2994
02:35:47,048 --> 02:35:49,918
You need to stop
playing the martyr.

2995
02:35:50,919 --> 02:35:53,321
Under the current
AEC guidelines,

2996
02:35:53,355 --> 02:35:55,756
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2997
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:04,299
Under my interpretation

2998
02:36:04,332 --> 02:36:06,468
of the Atomic Energy Act,

2999
02:36:06,501 --> 02:36:08,336
which did not exist

3000
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:11,206
when I hired
Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942...

3001
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:15,844
I would not clear him today,

3002
02:36:15,877 --> 02:36:17,846
uh, if I were on the commission.

3003
02:36:17,879 --> 02:36:19,457
Good. Thank you,
General. That is all.

3004
02:36:19,481 --> 02:36:21,483
But I don't think I'd
clear any of those guys.

3005
02:36:21,516 --> 02:36:23,684
That's all.

3006
02:36:26,188 --> 02:36:28,323
Dr. Oppenheimer
had no responsibility

3007
02:36:28,356 --> 02:36:29,858
in the selection
or the clearance

3008
02:36:29,891 --> 02:36:31,193
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

3009
02:36:31,226 --> 02:36:32,494
No. None at all.

3010
02:36:32,527 --> 02:36:34,129
And you wouldn't want
to leave this board

3011
02:36:34,162 --> 02:36:36,932
with any suggestion today
that you're here questioning

3012
02:36:36,965 --> 02:36:39,000
his basic loyalty
to the United States

3013
02:36:39,034 --> 02:36:40,435
in the operation of Los Alamos?

3014
02:36:40,468 --> 02:36:42,037
By no means.

3015
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:44,072
I hope I didn't lead
anyone to believe otherwise

3016
02:36:44,105 --> 02:36:45,739
for an instant.

3017
02:36:45,773 --> 02:36:46,875
Thank you, General.

3018
02:37:04,926 --> 02:37:07,195
Okay. We shouldn't
keep them waiting.

3019
02:37:07,229 --> 02:37:08,496
She'll be here.

3020
02:37:08,530 --> 02:37:09,965
Do you even want her here?

3021
02:37:09,998 --> 02:37:12,500
Only a fool or an adolescent

3022
02:37:12,534 --> 02:37:14,436
presumes to know someone
else's relationship,

3023
02:37:14,469 --> 02:37:16,770
and you're neither, Lloyd.

3024
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:20,308
Kitty and I,

3025
02:37:20,342 --> 02:37:22,410
we're grown-ups.

3026
02:37:22,444 --> 02:37:25,280
<i>We've walked through
fire together.</i>

3027
02:37:25,313 --> 02:37:27,882
She'll do fine.

3028
02:37:27,916 --> 02:37:29,985
Would you describe
your views on Communism

3029
02:37:30,018 --> 02:37:32,053
as pro, anti, neutral?

3030
02:37:32,087 --> 02:37:33,955
Very strongly against.

3031
02:37:33,989 --> 02:37:36,124
I-I've had nothing to do
with Communism in... since...

3032
02:37:36,157 --> 02:37:38,994
since 1936, since...

3033
02:37:39,027 --> 02:37:41,896
since before I met Robert.

3034
02:37:42,497 --> 02:37:44,332
That's all.

3035
02:37:44,366 --> 02:37:45,934
<i>The record demonstrates</i>

3036
02:37:45,967 --> 02:37:47,569
<i>that Oppenheimer
was not interrogated</i>

3037
02:37:47,602 --> 02:37:50,839
<i>by impartial and disinterested
counsel for the Gray board.</i>

3038
02:37:50,872 --> 02:37:52,274
<i>He was interrogated
by a prosecutor</i>

3039
02:37:52,307 --> 02:37:53,975
<i>who used all the tricks</i>

3040
02:37:54,009 --> 02:37:55,810
<i>of a rather ingenious
legal background.</i>

3041
02:37:55,844 --> 02:37:57,279
You
are charging now

3042
02:37:57,312 --> 02:38:00,282
that the Gray board
permitted a prosecution.

3043
02:38:00,315 --> 02:38:03,018
If I were on the Gray board,

3044
02:38:03,051 --> 02:38:05,020
I would have protested
against the tactics

3045
02:38:05,053 --> 02:38:07,956
of the man who served, in fact,
as the prosecuting counsel.

3046
02:38:07,989 --> 02:38:11,192
A man appointed not by the board

3047
02:38:11,226 --> 02:38:13,295
but by Lewis Strauss.

3048
02:38:15,297 --> 02:38:16,331
Who was this?

3049
02:38:17,632 --> 02:38:19,467
I'm sorry?

3050
02:38:19,501 --> 02:38:20,568
Who was this?

3051
02:38:20,602 --> 02:38:22,037
Uh, Roger Robb.

3052
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:24,406
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

3053
02:38:28,610 --> 02:38:31,046
Did you have a Communist
Party membership card?

3054
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:34,582
I'm... I'm not sure.

3055
02:38:34,616 --> 02:38:36,117
Not sure?

3056
02:38:39,087 --> 02:38:40,088
Well...

3057
02:38:42,490 --> 02:38:44,225
Well?

3058
02:38:53,168 --> 02:38:56,137
I mean, presumably, the
act of joining the Party

3059
02:38:56,171 --> 02:38:59,941
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

3060
02:39:03,111 --> 02:39:04,245
Yeah.

3061
02:39:09,617 --> 02:39:11,019
Sorry.

3062
02:39:11,653 --> 02:39:13,254
Yes. Mm.

3063
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:17,092
It's just it was all
so very long ago,

3064
02:39:17,125 --> 02:39:18,960
- Mr. Robb, wasn't it?
- Not really.

3065
02:39:18,993 --> 02:39:20,228
Long enough to have forgotten.

3066
02:39:20,261 --> 02:39:21,639
Did you return the
card or rip it up?

3067
02:39:21,663 --> 02:39:23,264
The card whose existence
I've forgotten?

3068
02:39:23,298 --> 02:39:25,100
Your Communist Party
membership card.

3069
02:39:25,133 --> 02:39:26,868
Haven't the slightest idea.

3070
02:39:29,170 --> 02:39:31,940
Can a distinction
be made between

3071
02:39:31,973 --> 02:39:33,641
Soviet Communism and Communism?

3072
02:39:33,675 --> 02:39:35,243
Well, in the days
when I was a member,

3073
02:39:35,276 --> 02:39:36,916
I thought they were
definitely two things.

3074
02:39:36,945 --> 02:39:38,213
- Oh?
- I thought that

3075
02:39:38,246 --> 02:39:40,115
the Communist Party
of the United States

3076
02:39:40,148 --> 02:39:42,550
was concerned with
our domestic problems.

3077
02:39:42,584 --> 02:39:44,052
I now no longer believe this.

3078
02:39:44,085 --> 02:39:45,129
Believe the whole
thing's linked together

3079
02:39:45,153 --> 02:39:46,421
and spread all over the world,

3080
02:39:46,454 --> 02:39:48,656
and I have believed this
since I left the Party

3081
02:39:48,690 --> 02:39:50,158
16 years ago.

3082
02:39:50,191 --> 02:39:51,493
- But...
- Seventeen years ago.

3083
02:39:51,526 --> 02:39:52,927
My mistake.

3084
02:39:52,961 --> 02:39:55,597
- But you said...
- Sorry, 18.

3085
02:39:55,630 --> 02:39:57,899
Eighteen years ago.

3086
02:39:58,700 --> 02:40:00,010
Are you
familiar with the fact

3087
02:40:00,034 --> 02:40:01,212
your husband was
making contributions

3088
02:40:01,236 --> 02:40:04,305
to the Spanish Civil
War as late as 1942?

3089
02:40:04,339 --> 02:40:06,217
I knew that Robert gave
money from time to time.

3090
02:40:06,241 --> 02:40:07,485
Did you know this
money was going

3091
02:40:07,509 --> 02:40:08,943
into Communist Party channels?

3092
02:40:08,977 --> 02:40:10,412
Don't you mean "through"?

3093
02:40:10,445 --> 02:40:12,213
- Pardon?
- I think you mean

3094
02:40:12,247 --> 02:40:14,048
"through Communist Party
channels," don't you?

3095
02:40:14,082 --> 02:40:15,316
- Y-Yes!
- Yes?

3096
02:40:15,350 --> 02:40:17,252
- Yes!
- Yes.

3097
02:40:17,285 --> 02:40:20,989
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

3098
02:40:21,022 --> 02:40:22,323
your husband had not stopped

3099
02:40:22,357 --> 02:40:24,292
having anything to do
with the Communist Party?

3100
02:40:24,325 --> 02:40:26,127
You don't have to
answer that yes or no.

3101
02:40:26,161 --> 02:40:27,538
You can answer that
any way you wish.

3102
02:40:27,562 --> 02:40:29,431
I know that, thank you.

3103
02:40:29,464 --> 02:40:31,166
It's your question.

3104
02:40:31,199 --> 02:40:33,101
- It's not properly phrased.
- Do you understand

3105
02:40:33,134 --> 02:40:34,369
- what I'm getting at?
- I do.

3106
02:40:34,402 --> 02:40:35,679
Then why don't you
answer it that way?

3107
02:40:35,703 --> 02:40:37,305
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

3108
02:40:37,338 --> 02:40:39,274
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

3109
02:40:39,307 --> 02:40:41,109
Because Robert never
had anything to do

3110
02:40:41,142 --> 02:40:42,444
with the Communist
Party as such.

3111
02:40:42,477 --> 02:40:45,113
I know he gave money
to Spanish refugees.

3112
02:40:45,146 --> 02:40:47,081
I know he took an
intellectual interest

3113
02:40:47,115 --> 02:40:48,316
in Communist ideas...

3114
02:40:48,349 --> 02:40:49,460
Are there two types
of Communists?

3115
02:40:49,484 --> 02:40:51,186
Intellectual Communists

3116
02:40:51,219 --> 02:40:53,154
and your plain old
regular Commie?

3117
02:40:54,155 --> 02:40:55,723
Well, I couldn't
answer that one.

3118
02:40:55,757 --> 02:40:58,526
I
couldn't either.

3119
02:41:04,666 --> 02:41:06,468
Evening.

3120
02:41:06,501 --> 02:41:08,236
Robert, you
can't win this thing.

3121
02:41:08,269 --> 02:41:10,214
It's a kangaroo court with
a predetermined outcome.

3122
02:41:10,238 --> 02:41:12,173
Why put yourself
through more of it?

3123
02:41:12,774 --> 02:41:15,210
I have my reasons.

3124
02:41:15,811 --> 02:41:17,245
All right.

3125
02:41:17,278 --> 02:41:18,413
Good night.

3126
02:41:23,117 --> 02:41:24,519
He has a point.

3127
02:41:25,453 --> 02:41:27,489
I'm not sure you
understand, Albert.

3128
02:41:27,522 --> 02:41:28,623
No?

3129
02:41:28,656 --> 02:41:32,160
I left my country
never to return.

3130
02:41:32,794 --> 02:41:34,762
You served your country well.

3131
02:41:34,796 --> 02:41:38,433
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

3132
02:41:38,466 --> 02:41:42,103
perhaps you should
turn your back on her.

3133
02:41:42,136 --> 02:41:44,772
Damn it, I happen to
love this country.

3134
02:41:44,806 --> 02:41:47,408
Then tell them to go to hell.

3135
02:41:47,442 --> 02:41:48,343
Interestingly enough,

3136
02:41:48,376 --> 02:41:51,446
this is no longer a
confirmation hearing,

3137
02:41:51,479 --> 02:41:53,648
it's now a trial...

3138
02:41:53,681 --> 02:41:55,416
about a trial!

3139
02:41:56,417 --> 02:41:57,728
It's not good he's
telling everyone

3140
02:41:57,752 --> 02:41:59,053
you initiated the hearings.

3141
02:41:59,087 --> 02:42:01,456
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

3142
02:42:01,489 --> 02:42:04,158
He certainly can't prove that
I gave the file to Borden.

3143
02:42:04,192 --> 02:42:06,528
We're not in court, sir.

3144
02:42:06,561 --> 02:42:07,762
There's no burden of proof.

3145
02:42:07,795 --> 02:42:10,164
Right. They're not convicting...

3146
02:42:10,198 --> 02:42:11,466
just denying.

3147
02:42:11,499 --> 02:42:14,402
Why would Hill come
here to tear me down?

3148
02:42:14,435 --> 02:42:16,070
What's his angle?

3149
02:42:16,104 --> 02:42:18,206
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

3150
02:42:18,239 --> 02:42:19,842
- As he sees it.
- I told you,

3151
02:42:19,875 --> 02:42:22,544
Oppenheimer poisoned the
scientists against me,

3152
02:42:22,577 --> 02:42:24,279
right from that first meeting.

3153
02:42:24,312 --> 02:42:27,549
<i>I don't know what Oppenheimer
said to him that day,</i>

3154
02:42:27,582 --> 02:42:30,318
but Einstein wouldn't
even meet my eye.

3155
02:42:31,419 --> 02:42:34,522
<i>Oppenheimer knows how
to manipulate his own.</i>

3156
02:42:34,556 --> 02:42:35,824
And at Los Alamos,

3157
02:42:35,858 --> 02:42:38,192
he preyed on the
naivete of scientists

3158
02:42:38,226 --> 02:42:40,528
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work,

3159
02:42:40,562 --> 02:42:43,565
but don't ever think he
was that naive himself.

3160
02:42:43,598 --> 02:42:44,867
Doctor.

3161
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:46,869
During your work on
the hydrogen bomb,

3162
02:42:46,902 --> 02:42:50,572
were you deterred
by any moral qualms?

3163
02:42:50,605 --> 02:42:52,240
Yes, of course.

3164
02:42:52,273 --> 02:42:53,584
But you still got on
with your work, didn't you?

3165
02:42:53,608 --> 02:42:55,844
Yes, because this was
work of exploration,

3166
02:42:55,878 --> 02:42:58,112
it was not the
preparation of a weapon.

3167
02:42:58,146 --> 02:43:00,214
You mean it was more of
a... an academic excursion.

3168
02:43:00,248 --> 02:43:02,150
No, it is not an academic thing

3169
02:43:02,183 --> 02:43:03,594
whether you can build
a hydrogen bomb.

3170
02:43:03,618 --> 02:43:05,219
It's a matter of life and death.

3171
02:43:05,253 --> 02:43:06,621
By 1942, you were
actively pushing

3172
02:43:06,654 --> 02:43:08,232
the development of the
hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

3173
02:43:08,256 --> 02:43:09,490
Pushing's not the right word.

3174
02:43:09,524 --> 02:43:11,459
Supporting it and
working on it, yes.

3175
02:43:11,492 --> 02:43:13,829
So when did these moral
qualms become so strong

3176
02:43:13,862 --> 02:43:15,496
that you actively opposed

3177
02:43:15,530 --> 02:43:17,198
the development of
the hydrogen bomb?

3178
02:43:17,231 --> 02:43:19,200
When it was suggested
that it be the policy

3179
02:43:19,233 --> 02:43:21,402
of the United States to make
these things at all cost

3180
02:43:21,436 --> 02:43:23,438
without regard to the
balance between these weapons

3181
02:43:23,471 --> 02:43:26,541
and atomic weapons as
part of our arsenal.

3182
02:43:27,910 --> 02:43:29,845
What do moral qualms
have to do with that?

3183
02:43:29,878 --> 02:43:31,914
Wha... What do moral qualms

3184
02:43:31,947 --> 02:43:33,481
- have to do with it?
- Yes.

3185
02:43:33,514 --> 02:43:35,583
Oppenheimer wanted to
own the atomic bomb.

3186
02:43:35,617 --> 02:43:37,518
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

3187
02:43:37,552 --> 02:43:40,722
He talks about putting
the nuclear genie

3188
02:43:40,755 --> 02:43:42,223
back in the bottle.

3189
02:43:42,256 --> 02:43:43,391
Well, I'm here to tell you

3190
02:43:43,424 --> 02:43:45,627
that I know J.
Robert Oppenheimer,

3191
02:43:45,660 --> 02:43:49,764
and if he could do it all
over, he'd do it all the same.

3192
02:43:49,797 --> 02:43:52,835
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

3193
02:43:52,868 --> 02:43:55,737
He'd do it all over. Why?

3194
02:43:55,770 --> 02:43:57,205
Because it made him

3195
02:43:57,238 --> 02:43:58,874
the most important
man who ever lived.

3196
02:43:58,907 --> 02:44:01,242
Well, we've...

3197
02:44:01,275 --> 02:44:03,378
we've freely used
the atomic bomb...

3198
02:44:03,411 --> 02:44:05,513
In fact, Doctor,
you assisted in selecting

3199
02:44:05,546 --> 02:44:06,958
the target to drop the
atomic bomb on Japan,

3200
02:44:06,982 --> 02:44:08,650
- didn't you?
- Yes.

3201
02:44:08,683 --> 02:44:10,327
Well, then you knew,
did you not, that by dropping

3202
02:44:10,351 --> 02:44:12,520
that atomic bomb on the
target you selected,

3203
02:44:12,553 --> 02:44:13,965
that thousands of
civilians would be killed

3204
02:44:13,989 --> 02:44:15,723
or injured, is that correct?

3205
02:44:15,757 --> 02:44:17,659
Yes, not as many
as turned out...

3206
02:44:17,692 --> 02:44:19,895
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

3207
02:44:19,928 --> 02:44:21,796
- 70,000.
- 70,000

3208
02:44:21,830 --> 02:44:22,898
at both Hiroshima and...

3209
02:44:22,931 --> 02:44:24,365
110,000 at both.

3210
02:44:24,399 --> 02:44:25,800
On the day
of each bombing?

3211
02:44:27,769 --> 02:44:28,937
Yes.

3212
02:44:28,971 --> 02:44:30,547
And in the weeks and
years that followed?

3213
02:44:30,571 --> 02:44:33,274
It has been put at somewhere
between 50 and 100,000.

3214
02:44:33,307 --> 02:44:35,410
- 220,000 dead at least?
- Yes.

3215
02:44:35,443 --> 02:44:37,345
Any moral scruples about that?

3216
02:44:38,713 --> 02:44:39,815
Terrible ones.

3217
02:44:39,848 --> 02:44:41,416
But yet you testified in here

3218
02:44:41,449 --> 02:44:43,819
that the bombing of Hiroshima
was very successful.

3219
02:44:43,852 --> 02:44:45,420
- Technically successful.
- Oh!

3220
02:44:45,453 --> 02:44:47,221
Technically, it was
very successful.

3221
02:44:47,255 --> 02:44:48,732
And it is also alleged to
have helped end the war.

3222
02:44:48,756 --> 02:44:50,725
Would you have been in
support of the dropping

3223
02:44:50,758 --> 02:44:52,694
of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

3224
02:44:52,727 --> 02:44:54,262
That would make no sense at all.

3225
02:44:54,295 --> 02:44:56,731
- Why?
- The-the target is too small.

3226
02:44:56,764 --> 02:44:59,267
Well, supposing there had
been a target in Japan

3227
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:00,778
big enough for a
thermonuclear weapon,

3228
02:45:00,802 --> 02:45:02,579
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

3229
02:45:02,603 --> 02:45:04,448
This was not a problem with
which I was confronted...

3230
02:45:04,472 --> 02:45:05,917
Well, I'm confronting
you with it now, sir.

3231
02:45:05,941 --> 02:45:07,709
It was all part of his plan.

3232
02:45:07,742 --> 02:45:09,310
He wanted the glorious,

3233
02:45:09,343 --> 02:45:11,512
insincere guilt of
the self-important

3234
02:45:11,546 --> 02:45:13,015
to wear like a fuckin' crown.

3235
02:45:13,048 --> 02:45:16,484
Say, "No, we cannot
go down this road,"

3236
02:45:16,517 --> 02:45:19,320
even as he knew we'd have to.

3237
02:45:19,353 --> 02:45:20,899
Would you have been
opposed to the dropping

3238
02:45:20,923 --> 02:45:22,590
of a thermonuclear
weapon on Japan

3239
02:45:22,623 --> 02:45:24,869
- because of moral scruples?
- Yes, I believe I would, sir.

3240
02:45:24,893 --> 02:45:26,594
Well, did you
oppose the dropping

3241
02:45:26,627 --> 02:45:28,639
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

3242
02:45:28,663 --> 02:45:30,307
We set forth our arguments...

3243
02:45:30,331 --> 02:45:31,733
No, you, you, you.
I'm asking you.

3244
02:45:31,766 --> 02:45:33,410
- I set... I set forth...
- Not we. You, you, you!

3245
02:45:33,434 --> 02:45:35,037
Our arguments
against dropping it,

3246
02:45:35,070 --> 02:45:36,604
but I did not endorse them.

3247
02:45:36,637 --> 02:45:38,339
You mean after
working night and day

3248
02:45:38,372 --> 02:45:39,741
for three years
building the bomb,

3249
02:45:39,774 --> 02:45:41,614
you then argued against
the use of it?

3250
02:45:41,642 --> 02:45:44,345
I was asked by the
Secretary of War

3251
02:45:44,378 --> 02:45:45,747
what the views of
scientists were.

3252
02:45:45,780 --> 02:45:48,516
I gave him the views
against and the views for.

3253
02:45:48,549 --> 02:45:50,561
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

3254
02:45:50,585 --> 02:45:52,063
- What do you mean "support"?
- Didn't you?

3255
02:45:52,087 --> 02:45:53,564
- You supported it!
- What do you mean "support"?

3256
02:45:53,588 --> 02:45:54,933
Well, you helped pick
the target, didn't you?

3257
02:45:54,957 --> 02:45:56,591
I did my job.

3258
02:45:56,624 --> 02:45:58,368
I was not in a policy-making
position at Los Alamos.

3259
02:45:58,392 --> 02:46:00,038
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

3260
02:46:00,062 --> 02:46:02,330
Well, then you would have
built the H-bomb too,

3261
02:46:02,363 --> 02:46:03,498
- wouldn't you?
- I couldn't.

3262
02:46:03,531 --> 02:46:05,433
I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

3263
02:46:05,466 --> 02:46:07,802
And the GAC report
which you co-authored

3264
02:46:07,836 --> 02:46:09,704
after the Soviet
atomic test said

3265
02:46:09,737 --> 02:46:12,406
a Super bomb should
never be built!

3266
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:13,775
What we meant,
what I meant was...

3267
02:46:13,808 --> 02:46:15,878
- What you, who? Who?
- What I meant...

3268
02:46:17,645 --> 02:46:19,085
And wouldn't the
Russians do anything

3269
02:46:19,114 --> 02:46:21,382
to increase their strength?

3270
02:46:21,415 --> 02:46:23,393
If we did
it, they would have to do it.

3271
02:46:23,417 --> 02:46:25,453
Our efforts would only
fuel their efforts,

3272
02:46:25,486 --> 02:46:27,588
just as it had with
the atomic bomb.

3273
02:46:27,622 --> 02:46:31,026
"Just as it had with the
atomic bomb," exactly!

3274
02:46:31,059 --> 02:46:35,797
No moral scruples in
1945, plenty in 1949.

3275
02:46:39,935 --> 02:46:41,769
Dr. Oppenheimer...

3276
02:46:43,437 --> 02:46:46,041
when did your strong
moral convictions develop

3277
02:46:46,074 --> 02:46:48,877
with respect to
the hydrogen bomb?

3278
02:46:55,918 --> 02:46:58,821
When it became clear to me

3279
02:46:58,854 --> 02:47:02,490
that we would tend to
use any weapon we had.

3280
02:47:04,927 --> 02:47:07,428
<i>J. Robert
Oppenheimer, the martyr.</i>

3281
02:47:07,461 --> 02:47:10,065
I gave him exactly
what he wanted.

3282
02:47:10,098 --> 02:47:12,366
To be remembered for Trinity,

3283
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:15,003
not Hiroshima,

3284
02:47:15,037 --> 02:47:17,471
not Nagasaki.

3285
02:47:20,008 --> 02:47:22,710
He should be thanking me.

3286
02:47:22,743 --> 02:47:25,680
Well, he's not.

3287
02:47:27,515 --> 02:47:29,117
Do we still have enough votes,

3288
02:47:29,151 --> 02:47:30,819
or is the crowning
moment of my career

3289
02:47:30,853 --> 02:47:34,990
about to become the most
public humiliation of my life?

3290
02:47:35,023 --> 02:47:37,592
Full Senate's about to vote.

3291
02:47:37,625 --> 02:47:38,793
You'll scrape through.

3292
02:47:38,827 --> 02:47:40,461
Great, then gather
the fucking press.

3293
02:47:40,494 --> 02:47:42,463
Dr. J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

3294
02:47:42,496 --> 02:47:45,466
This board, having
heard testimony from you

3295
02:47:45,499 --> 02:47:48,636
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

3296
02:47:48,669 --> 02:47:50,671
has come to the
unanimous conclusion

3297
02:47:50,705 --> 02:47:53,808
that you are a loyal citizen.

3298
02:47:55,110 --> 02:47:56,744
However,

3299
02:47:56,777 --> 02:48:00,414
in the light of your
continuing associations

3300
02:48:00,448 --> 02:48:01,716
and disregard

3301
02:48:01,749 --> 02:48:03,886
for the security
apparatus of this country,

3302
02:48:03,919 --> 02:48:07,455
together with your
somewhat disturbing conduct

3303
02:48:07,488 --> 02:48:10,025
on the hydrogen bomb program

3304
02:48:10,058 --> 02:48:11,592
and the regrettable
lack of candor

3305
02:48:11,626 --> 02:48:13,996
in certain of your
responses to this board,

3306
02:48:14,029 --> 02:48:16,899
we have voted two to one

3307
02:48:16,932 --> 02:48:20,035
to deny the renewal of
your security clearance.

3308
02:48:20,068 --> 02:48:23,171
A full written opinion, with
a dissent from Mr. Evans,

3309
02:48:23,205 --> 02:48:26,707
will be issued to the
AEC in the coming days.

3310
02:48:26,741 --> 02:48:28,409
That is all.

3311
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:33,514
- Gordon...
- Roger.

3312
02:48:38,552 --> 02:48:40,454
<i>Robert.</i>

3313
02:48:41,089 --> 02:48:42,623
Robert.

3314
02:48:45,093 --> 02:48:46,594
Don't...

3315
02:48:48,964 --> 02:48:52,167
Don't take in the sheets.

3316
02:48:53,567 --> 02:48:54,970
Get a
picture with him.

3317
02:48:55,003 --> 02:48:56,238
Sir, sir.

3318
02:48:56,271 --> 02:48:58,739
Two
minutes. Two minutes.

3319
02:48:58,773 --> 02:48:59,984
- You'll get your shot.
- Please, sir.

3320
02:49:00,008 --> 02:49:01,575
We've been waiting for so long.

3321
02:49:01,609 --> 02:49:02,619
- Evening, sir.
- Come out.

3322
02:49:02,643 --> 02:49:03,678
Sir, sir!

3323
02:49:03,711 --> 02:49:05,047
Is it official?

3324
02:49:07,149 --> 02:49:08,549
Well, there were,

3325
02:49:08,582 --> 02:49:11,719
uh, a couple of
unexpected holdouts.

3326
02:49:16,158 --> 02:49:18,827
I'm denied. Yeah?

3327
02:49:18,860 --> 02:49:20,829
- I'm afraid so, sir.
- All right.

3328
02:49:28,536 --> 02:49:29,603
Who were the holdouts?

3329
02:49:29,637 --> 02:49:32,573
Um, there were three,

3330
02:49:32,606 --> 02:49:35,543
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

3331
02:49:35,576 --> 02:49:36,988
Young guy trying to
make a name for himself,

3332
02:49:37,012 --> 02:49:39,580
didn't like what you
did to Oppenheimer.

3333
02:49:39,613 --> 02:49:40,748
What's his name?

3334
02:49:40,781 --> 02:49:42,985
Uh, Kennedy.

3335
02:49:43,018 --> 02:49:44,820
John F. Kennedy.

3336
02:49:48,290 --> 02:49:49,690
Kitty?

3337
02:49:55,763 --> 02:49:59,167
Did you think that if you
let them tar and feather you,

3338
02:49:59,201 --> 02:50:01,769
that the world
would forgive you?

3339
02:50:05,307 --> 02:50:06,741
It won't.

3340
02:50:09,111 --> 02:50:10,511
We'll see.

3341
02:50:20,288 --> 02:50:22,290
Goddamn it.

3342
02:50:23,825 --> 02:50:26,761
You
told me I'd be okay.

3343
02:50:26,794 --> 02:50:29,164
Yeah, well, I didn't have
all the facts, did I?

3344
02:50:29,197 --> 02:50:30,765
Here's a fact.

3345
02:50:30,798 --> 02:50:32,642
President Eisenhower
pinned the Medal of Freedom

3346
02:50:32,666 --> 02:50:34,102
on my chest last year

3347
02:50:34,136 --> 02:50:36,637
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

3348
02:50:36,670 --> 02:50:39,174
They don't want me
in the Cabinet room?

3349
02:50:39,207 --> 02:50:41,642
Well, that's... that's fine.

3350
02:50:41,675 --> 02:50:44,012
Maybe they should just
invite Oppenheimer instead.

3351
02:50:44,046 --> 02:50:45,080
Maybe they will.

3352
02:50:46,081 --> 02:50:47,315
I told you,

3353
02:50:47,349 --> 02:50:49,985
he turned the scientists
against me one by one,

3354
02:50:50,018 --> 02:50:52,187
starting with Einstein. I
told you about, uh, Einstein.

3355
02:50:52,220 --> 02:50:53,654
I saw him by the pond.

3356
02:50:53,687 --> 02:50:55,190
You did, but you know, sir,

3357
02:50:55,223 --> 02:50:57,225
since nobody really knows

3358
02:50:57,259 --> 02:50:58,894
what they said to
each other that day,

3359
02:50:58,927 --> 02:51:02,964
is it possible they didn't
talk about you at all?

3360
02:51:02,998 --> 02:51:06,134
Is it possible they spoke
about something, uh,

3361
02:51:06,168 --> 02:51:07,601
more important?

3362
02:51:07,635 --> 02:51:09,071
Mr. Strauss!

3363
02:51:12,407 --> 02:51:14,809
Over here! Mr. Strauss!

3364
02:51:17,946 --> 02:51:21,216
Oh.

3365
02:51:22,384 --> 02:51:23,684
Thank you.

3366
02:51:23,717 --> 02:51:26,221
Albert.

3367
02:51:26,254 --> 02:51:28,223
Ah.

3368
02:51:28,256 --> 02:51:30,758
The man of the moment.

3369
02:51:33,862 --> 02:51:37,232
You once held a-a
reception for me.

3370
02:51:37,265 --> 02:51:39,067
In Berkeley. You
gave me an award.

3371
02:51:39,101 --> 02:51:40,969
- Hmm?
- Yes.

3372
02:51:41,870 --> 02:51:44,272
You all thought that
I had lost the ability

3373
02:51:44,306 --> 02:51:47,242
to understand what I'd started.

3374
02:51:47,275 --> 02:51:50,711
So the award really
wasn't for me,

3375
02:51:50,744 --> 02:51:53,148
it was for all of you, hmm?

3376
02:51:55,016 --> 02:51:57,018
Now it's your turn

3377
02:51:57,052 --> 02:52:01,755
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

3378
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:03,992
And one day,

3379
02:52:04,025 --> 02:52:06,660
when they've punished
you enough...

3380
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:11,967
they'll serve you
salmon and potato salad.

3381
02:52:15,703 --> 02:52:17,738
Make speeches...

3382
02:52:18,772 --> 02:52:20,275
<i>give you a medal.</i>

3383
02:52:21,977 --> 02:52:24,146
Hello, Frank.

3384
02:52:24,179 --> 02:52:25,413
You're happy, I'm happy.

3385
02:52:32,387 --> 02:52:35,723
<i>Pat you on the back,
tell you all is forgiven.</i>

3386
02:52:37,259 --> 02:52:39,660
<i>Just remember...</i>

3387
02:52:40,295 --> 02:52:42,164
<i>it won't be for you.</i>

3388
02:52:46,434 --> 02:52:48,069
<i>It'll be for them.</i>

3389
02:53:02,217 --> 02:53:03,751
Albert.

3390
02:53:04,986 --> 02:53:08,456
When I came to you with
those calculations,

3391
02:53:08,490 --> 02:53:10,724
we thought we might
start a chain reaction

3392
02:53:10,758 --> 02:53:14,229
that would destroy
the entire world.

3393
02:53:14,262 --> 02:53:17,731
Mm, I remember it well.

3394
02:53:17,765 --> 02:53:19,834
What of it?

3395
02:53:22,470 --> 02:53:24,206
I believe we did.
