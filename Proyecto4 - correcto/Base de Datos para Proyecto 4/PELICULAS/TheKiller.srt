<i>I have to ask,</i>

92
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,833
<i>based on what, exactly?</i>

93
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,375
<i>I used to book a lot through Airbnb.</i>

94
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,208
<i>Not anymore.</i>

95
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,708
<i>Those Superhosts love their nanny cams.</i>

96
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,916

<i>are the direct result</i>

98
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,083
<i>of eyewitness testimony.</i>

99
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:10,041
<i>Still, it only takes
a few episodes of</i> Dateline

101

<i>If you can think of a dozen,

102
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,958
<i>I'm no genius.</i>

103
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:32,000
<i>From the beginning of history,
the few have always exploited the many.</i>

104
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,875
<i>This is the cornerstone of civilization.</i>

105
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,875
<i>The blood in the mortar

106
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,875
<i>Whatever it takes,</i>

00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,916
<i>make sure you're one of the few,</i>

108
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,125
<i>not one of the many.</i>

109
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,500
<i>On Annie Oakley jobs,

110

<i>Everything else,

111
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,791
<i>the breaking of glass,

112
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,791
<i>When it comes
to bystanders getting involved,</i>

113
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,208

<i>That's not Dylan Thomas,

119

<i>Somehow, jobs

121
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,458
<i>I've actually grown

122
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>Staged accidents, gradual poisonings.</i>

131

<i>Sheer caseload.</i>

132
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000

Shh. <i>Please</i> don't let her hear your voice.

246
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,500
She <i>needs</i> sleep.

247
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:37,000
They're monitoring for internal bleeding.

248
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:40,583
She just had a second transfusion,
and she's on heavy pain meds.

249
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,508
There were <i>two</i> of them.
She can describe them.

250
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,583
It's not like
they were disguising themselves.

251
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,791
One was a <i>woman.</i>

252
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:03,125
This wasn't a robbery.
She told me that... She...

253
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,375
- She might...
- Take your time.

254
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,625
"There are <i>worse</i> things
than what they did to me."

255
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,250
She kept telling me.

256
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,541
Can you <i>imagine?</i>

257
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,458
<i>Worse things?</i>

258
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,166
She told me that during the...

259
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,791
assault,

260
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,250
she stabbed a man,

261
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,851
ran through a fucking plate glass window,

262
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,475
- hid in the jungle...
- Marcus, <i>breathe.</i>

263
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,750
They left in a green car
with a light on top.

264
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,875
Like a fucking taxi.

265
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,250
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

266
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:35,291
Look, she knows
there are things she can and cannot say

267
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,750
if anyone comes asking.

268
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,753
All this time you've been very kind
to my sister.

269
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:39,791
She loves you.

270
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,583
I've learned not to pry.

271
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,000
<i>- But this...</i>
- Marcus.

272
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,125
They came for you,

273
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,000
<i>and they weren't about to leave a witness.</i>

274
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,375
Marcus, listen very carefully.

275
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,583
I promise, I <i>swear</i> to you,

276
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:55,625
nothing like this
will ever be allowed to happen again.

277
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,750
She's well enough to travel,
and later today, she'll be transported

278
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:21,083
to the private hospital
in Punta Cana as arranged.

279
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:34,625
No. You mustn't try...

280
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,625
Are you all right?

281
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:38,791
Let me see you.

282
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:43,875
I was <i>so</i> afraid.
Afraid I might say something.

283
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,208
But I didn't.

284
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,833
No matter what they said,

285
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,000
no matter what he did,

286
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,375
I didn't tell them anything.

287
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,625
Not <i>about you.</i>

288
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:56,500
<i>Nothing.</i>

289
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,958
You'd have been proud.

290
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,625
- I was <i>strong.</i>
- I know you were.

291
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:04,583
How... How bad is it?

292
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,000
I'll see soon enough, huh?

293
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,250
I told myself,

294
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,541
"If I don't make it,

295
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,000
if I don't survive,

296
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,333
I'll never see him again."

297
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,583
I couldn't bear that.

298
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:28,750
So, <i>I made up my mind.</i>

299
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,625
Get some rest now.

300
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:35,791
Okay.

301
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,166

302
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,958
Would you rather send this overnight?

303
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,333
So, for that rate,
this would be delivered two days from now,

304
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,333
end of business, Mr... Madison.

305

312
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,083

Oh shit, man.

321
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,750
I <i>just</i> started.
<i>Alguna moneda es lo único que tengo.</i>

322
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,250
I'll show you, okay?

323
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,208
<i>Take it,</i> man.

324
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:05,291
There's a rubber in there too...
what's mine is yours.

325
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,833
Take the wallet if you want.

326
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,291
<i>What else?</i> Hmm? Want my radio?

327
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,916
Tell me about your big fare, Leo,
three days ago.

328
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:14,916
What?

329
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,375
<i>Three days?</i> Hey.

330
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:21,083
<i>Wait, wait. Don't!</i>
Okay, I... I'll tell you. Um...

331
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:24,500
Uh...

332
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,250
The freak and the lady, <i>right?</i>

333
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,958
From the... From the private airport,
that's who?

334
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:34,375
I picked them up around noon.
I remember, it was right before lunch.

335
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:37,541
I'd been waiting around.
There was nothing. Slow day, slow week.

336
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,750
I was about to split when one
of those little jets came in, <i>so I stayed.</i>

337
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:44,333
And they come, two crazy-looking <i>güeros.</i>
And the lady? Like a Q-tip.

338
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,708
And the dude with her?

339
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:49,041
<i>Should've kept him on a leash.</i>
He was a scary motherfucker.

340
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:53,083
Walk me through your time with them
to the <i>very</i> best of your recollection.

341
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,166
No problem. I drove them. That's all.

342
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,416
"Round trip" was what they said,
then they told me north on Highway 1,

343
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,791
then deep into the damn jungle,
like forever.

344
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:05,791
They showed me on Google. I drove them.

345
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,333
They wouldn't take no for an answer.

346
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,916
We go to a private property,
and I was <i>supposed</i> to wait.

347
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:16,250
They were gone... an hour, maybe.

348
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:18,250
Take this next exit.

349
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,125
All I know is that I was starving

350
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,128
and I didn't care
how much the meter was ticking.

351
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:37,375
I was going to leave them.
I'm not allowed to, but I almost did.

352
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:38,791
Pull up in here.

353
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,083
They came back after sunset.

354
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,583
The guy's leg
was all bloody and fucked up.

355
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:01,333
They wanted me to take 'em back
to the airport, so I did.

356
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,291
That was the end of it.

357
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:07,958
May I?

358
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,250
Want one?

359
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,250
Ask me anything. <i>Anything.</i>

360
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:17,250
I don't know who they are.
<i>Don't wanna know who you are either.</i>

361
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,791
<i>Con todo respeto.</i>

362
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:29,041
So, how about I get out
and I <i>leave</i> the keys? I'll <i>walk</i> back...

363
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,916
And...

364
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,083
you're all set, Mr. Cunningham.

365
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:18,416

Thank you so much, man.

404
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:53,916
You're a lifesaver.

405
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,708
<i>One, one thousand.</i>

<i>Seven, one thousand.</i>

412
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,392
- Can't wait for it.
- No, I know.

413
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:36,583
Everything good?

414
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:38,392
Everything's good.
Just the one today?

415
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:41,416
- Just the one.
- Oh my goodness.

416
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:52,375
- Have a good one.
- See ya.

417
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,000
Hello, Dolores.

418
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,500
Hello. How...

419
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,583
Oh.

420
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,666
Oh my <i>God!</i>

421
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh my God. Oh my God.

422
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,625
Oh <i>my God.</i> Oh <i>my God.</i>

423
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,458
<i>- Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
- Stop saying that.</i>

424
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,541
- What is it, Dolores?
- I'm sorry, sir.

425
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,291
I <i>said</i> I need email ti...

426
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,416
Good God.

427
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,291
What could you <i>possibly</i> be thinking,
coming here?

428
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:56,041
This is very unlike you, my friend.
Care to explain yourself?

429
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,125
'Cause I can't conceive
of anything I have to offer

430
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:01,583
that could <i>remotely</i> be worth
the exposure you're risking right now.

431
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,500
Go ahead.

432
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,250
<i>Whatever</i> he says.

433
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,458
Insanity.

434
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,541
There's no other word for this. <i>Insanity.</i>

435
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:19,083
Surely you <i>can't</i> be angry with me.

436
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:21,541
I'm so sorry.
I... I... I opened the outer door.

437
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,083
- Dolores.
- The FedEx...

438
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,686
I'm the one who's sorry.

439
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,250
I sincerely apologize.

440
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,416
There's <i>clearly</i> been
some sort of misunderstanding.

441
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,083
I'd like to ask you to take a breath.

442
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:39,583
Think for a minute.

443
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,750
This'll be resolved in a moment, darlin'.
I promise you.

444
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:51,125
Once he realizes the folly of his actions.

445
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,250
You went <i>home?</i>

446
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,958
How <i>could</i> you have,
realizing my hands were...

447
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,958
You <i>had</i> to have known that I'd have no say
in the matter going forward.

448
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,875
- And <i>still,</i> you went home?
- Who were they?

449
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:04,833
Who were they?

450
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:06,458
First of all, <i>who cares?</i>

451
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,541
I barely glanced at the invoice, which,

452
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,625
if I may say,
is very much beside the point.

453
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,750
The consequences,
when someone's wide of the mark,

454
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,083
are <i>automatic.</i>

455
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:18,000
However regrettable, they're
an obligation to client and calling.

456
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:22,250
I was <i>forced</i> to make amends
to a <i>very</i> angry, <i>very</i> powerful man.

457
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:25,750
Never in my wildest imagination
did I think you'd actually go home.

458
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,000
Not in a million years.

459
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,875
<i>The fuck?</i> That's just juvenile.

460
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:36,000
Though it's not too late.

461
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,625
Even now,
this entire debacle can be salvaged.

462
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,541
But <i>only</i> if you disappear,

463
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:43,208
which is what I assumed
you've already done.

464
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:46,833
You've got more money
than you could ever spend,

465
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,250
thanks, in no small part, to me,

466
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,573
so why aren't you already
on the other side of the globe,

467
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:54,041
under any number of aliases, <i>spending it?</i>

468
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,625
You don't believe me,
don't feel you can trust me.

469
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:03,000
<i>Fine.</i> I suppose I brought that on myself.

470
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,791
But after all these years,
having built this from the ground up,

471
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,666
I thought we had a relationship.

472
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,333
It's all here somewhere.

473
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:13,375
I know you have backups, Eddie.

474
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,791
On me, everyone, the whole shebang.

475
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,625
'Cause you'd never put it on the Cloud

476
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,791
any more than you'd trust it
outside this office.

477
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:24,125
There's nothing like that.

478
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:27,541
Everything I dealt with
was on those two laptops.

479
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,375
And now, <i>it's not.</i>

480
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,500
Who do you think
you're <i>trying</i> to intimidate?

481
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:37,291
You're not gonna. There's no upside.

482
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,958
The only logical choice for you

483
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:44,791
is to turn around right now,
walk out that door,

484
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:47,166
go embrace your next life.

485
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:49,083
I wish you well.

486
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:56,791
You'll drown slowly,
then I'll dispose of you.

487
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,750
So while a few fragments
of your side-hustle

488
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,625
may be left to puzzle over...

489
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,375
...since you'll have completely vanished,

490
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,000
the trail ends where it began.

491
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,125
Unless...

492
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,083
I need that information, Edward.

493
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,833
And you are running outta time.

494
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:44,666
<i>Fuck...</i>

495
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:45,750
<i>you...</i>

496
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:50,375
<i>Three nine-gauge nails.
Early middle-aged nonsmoker.</i>

497
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:52,625
<i>About 180 pounds.</i>

498
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:59,875
<i>Should last six, seven minutes.</i>

499
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,291
<i>Shit.</i>

500
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:05,916
<i>Stick to the plan.</i>

501
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:09,958
<i>Anticipate, don't improvise.</i>

502
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,541
<i>Fight only the battle
you're paid to fight.</i>

503
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,750
<i>Trust no one.</i>

504
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,791
I'd beg
if I thought it would do any good.

505
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:34,000
I <i>have</i> the names you're looking for.
I know who they were.

506
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:39,666
But... before I give them to you,
I want something in return...

507
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:44,916
I know what you're capable of,
how you can...

508
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,083
make things <i>seem.</i>

509
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,875
I'll give you those names,

510
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:56,625
but promise me you won't leave things
looking the wrong way.

511
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,625
<i>Please.</i>

512
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:03,000
I can't just disappear.

513
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,083
My children need my life insur...

514
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,666
<i>Forbid empathy.</i>

515
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,458
I guess I <i>am</i> begging.

516
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,291
<i>Empathy is weakness.</i>

517
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,625
<i>Weakness is vulnerability.</i>

<i>It's common knowledge

651

Wait, wait, wait...

655
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:19,458
I've been so good for so long.

656
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:22,416

- May I bring a menu?
- No menu. Thank you, Carl.

658
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:31,041
You won't mind if I have a drink.

My pleasure.

661
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:38,250
By a drink, I mean, of course, <i>many.</i>

Tell me Hodges is dead, at least.
Give me that.

Help yourself.

665
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:57,000
The chef sends out
anything he imagines I might like.

666
01:27:57,083 --> 01:28:00,125
This is, uh, his signature dish.
It's delicious.

667
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,458
You won't find better, even in the city.

668
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:08,583
You would be very impolite
to refuse to join in my <i>last</i> supper.

669
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:13,750
Afraid it's tainted?

670
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:24,208
I'm assuming you've also paid a visit
to a certain overadrenalized Floridian.

671
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:25,333
No loss there.

672
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:27,708
- Here we are.
- Oh, that was quick.

673
01:28:27,791 --> 01:28:29,791
May I describe the selection?

674
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:32,708
You know, by the time you're finished,
they'd all be gone.

675
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:33,791
Cheers.

676
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,750
You won't imbibe either?

678
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:54,833
For what it's worth,

679
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:58,250
I would never have involved
your female friend.

680
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,708
What happened to her, I had <i>no</i> part in.

681
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:03,875
I objected to his methods,
and I told him so.

682
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:05,958
But you've seen for yourself how...

683
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:09,833
receptive...

684
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:14,083
You... you get a name, you get an address.

685
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:15,291
It's nothing personal.

686
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:18,000
We've all had to work
through the occasional civilian

687
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:20,458
who's stood between eyes and the prize.

688
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:39,500
When I started,
I was surprised at what I was capable of.

689
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:42,625
How easy it was.

690
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:44,000
Shockingly.

691
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:49,333
Yet, I assured myself
there were some things I would never do.

692
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,708
Money was motivation.

693
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:54,666
Which...

694
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,375
once there was enough,
could be used to buy another life.

695
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,458
Another lie we told ourselves.

696
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:06,166
When, for example, was the last time
you bothered to ask yourself

697
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,500
why someone in your sights
was so thoroughly despised?

698
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:11,000
<i>Less</i> you know, the better.

699
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,000
"One man's cruelty
is another man's pragmatism."

700
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:14,500
That old chestnut.

701
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:27,541
A hunter goes into the woods,

702
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,541
and he sees this grizzly.

703
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,541
Biggest he's ever seen.

704
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:35,500
He raises his rifle, and he fires.

705
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,708
The bear falls, the hunter rushes forward,

706
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:40,500
and to his surprise,
there's nothing there.

707
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,708
There's <i>no</i> bear,
there's <i>no</i> broken twigs, there's <i>no</i> blood.

708
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:45,916
And then <i>suddenly,</i>

709
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,166
the grizzly throws this massive arm
around his shoulders and explains,

710
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:52,375
"You took your shot."

711
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,083
"You missed,

712
01:30:54,166 --> 01:30:56,500
so either I feast, or,

713
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,708
and the choice is yours,

714
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,083
I sodomize you."

715
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:04,291
Naturally, the hunter chooses life.

716
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:08,666
The next day,
the hunter returns to the woods

717
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,375
with a much bigger gun,
and he spots the bear again.

718
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:16,208
And he aims. He fires. The bear falls.

719
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:17,458
The hunter charges.

720
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:20,541
No sign of the bear,
<i>until</i> the bear is standing beside him,

721
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:23,375
saying, "You know the deal."

722
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,875
Indignity ensues.

723
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:29,125
The following day,
the hunter treks back to the wood.

724
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:30,375
This time with a bazooka.

725
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:34,125
He sees the bear,
lines him up in his crosshairs, fires.

726
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:36,333
The recoil from the bazooka
throws him backwards.

727
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:38,375
And he looks up as the smoke's clearing,

728
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:41,750
and there's the bear standing above him,
arms crossed.

729
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:43,791
And the bear squints.

730
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:49,541
"You're not <i>really</i> out here
for the hunting, <i>are you?"</i>

731
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:02,333
This could've been a hit-and-run,
carjacking, me falling on the ice.

732
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:04,375
And yet, <i>here</i> you are.

733
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:12,666
If I screamed right now,
I'd still end up dead.

734
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:14,458
You would make it out.

735
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,208
<i>Most likely.</i>

736
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,541
But not <i>clean,</i> you wouldn't.

737
01:32:20,041 --> 01:32:21,625
Why take this risk?

738
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,833
Desperate for conversation.

739
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:25,750
I'm flattered, but no.

740
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:30,083
You're here
because you couldn't help yourself.

741
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:35,083
You expected to sit across from me
and feel nothing but reassured.

742
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:38,416
Like that recent day
when you shouldered your weapon

743
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,583
and somehow...

744
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:41,750
<i>missed.</i>

745
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:53,000
How's it possible?

746
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:57,375
Having prepared myself
for this moment for so long,

747
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,750
I have <i>failed</i> to believe
that it would ever arrive.

748
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:14,458
How are we?

749
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:17,166
We're done. You can take everything.

750
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,250
Excellent.

751
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:31,541
They wouldn't happen to have any ice cream
back there, would they, Carl?

752
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:34,250
Oh. Were you interested
in a dessert menu?

753
01:33:37,416 --> 01:33:39,500
No. No, it's all right.

754
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,708
<i>Stick to the plan...</i>

755
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,625
<i>Anticipate, don't improvise.</i>

756
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:54,416
<i>Trust no...</i>

757
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,791
Are we there yet?

758
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:57,083
A little further?

759
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,583
Far be it from me,
but maybe down by the river?

760
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:04,583
Wow.

761
01:34:04,666 --> 01:34:07,583
Last minutes spent knowing
they're last minutes.

762
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,500
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

763
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:14,500
Who, come to think of it,
at this moment, is <i>you.</i>

764
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:17,833
You'll remember our conversation.

765
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:19,958
You will.

766
01:34:20,666 --> 01:34:22,416
When your time <i>does</i> arrive.

767
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:26,583
It won't be your life flashing
before your eyes, it'll be mine.

768
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:32,083
I suppose it'll be the closest
I can hope to come to haunting you.

769
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:54,250
Help a girl out, won't you?

770
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,500
<i>Trust no one.</i>

771
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:08,000
<i>This is what it takes...</i>

772
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:11,208
<i>...if you want to succeed.</i>

773
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:27,583
<i>Risky, this one.</i>

774
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,250
<i>Considering how police
tend to match their effort</i>

775
01:35:31,333 --> 01:35:34,083
<i>in direct proportion
to the victim's net worth.</i>

776
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,375
<i>Fuck it.</i>

777
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:49,791
<i>The thing about real wealth,
the more you've got,</i>

778
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:52,041
<i>the harder it is
to fade into the wallpaper.</i>

779
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:58,208
<i>Of course,</i> vanity plates <i>don't help.</i>

780
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,580
<i>You've arrived
at your destination.</i>

781
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:35,500
<i>I don't think this guy's Mossad.</i>

782
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,583
<i>I know he ain't Mensa.</i>

783
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,916
<i>Good luck with the Wordle.</i>

784
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:23,541
<i>Leave no loose ends,
nothing to dangle.</i>

785
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:25,875
<i>Sayonara, North America.</i>

786
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:29,458
If I might get your initials
here and here.

787
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:32,041
Dotting that I and crossing that T.

788
01:38:38,875 --> 01:38:39,916
Perfect.

789
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:42,791
Your business with us
is officially closed,

790
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:45,333
with everything transferred
to your Caribbean account.

791
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:48,916
I do hope we can be of service again
in the near future, Mr. Jefferson.

792
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:53,416
May I <i>mention,</i>

793
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:57,083
our wealth management advisors
would be <i>more than</i> happy to discuss

794
01:38:57,166 --> 01:38:59,625
our select investment opportunities.

795
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:01,208
<i>Interesting.</i>

796
01:39:12,166 --> 01:39:13,875
Hey. Hey, guys. Not here.

797
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:16,416
Guys, keep it moving. Thank you.

798
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Here you go.

799
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:21,875
Browning. Smith & Wesson. Colt.

800
01:39:21,958 --> 01:39:24,125
You don't see what you want,
I can always get it.

801
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,375
What's your pleasure, my man? .380?

802
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:27,875
Good enough for James Bond.

803
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:30,625
How about this right here?
Gut-rippin' .38?

804
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,375
There's the Desert Eagle,

805
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:34,458
if you're looking
for something relatively portable

806
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,750
that can lay down an elk.

807
01:39:35,833 --> 01:39:39,500
My man knows his way around
a Glock subcompact.

808
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,041
Brings his <i>own</i> potato.

809
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:44,333
Yeehaw, man.

810
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,541
I like you, slim.
Next gun is half off.

811
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:53,625
This is plenty.

812
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:55,625
- Want ammo?
- No, thank you.

813
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:57,458
No ammo.

814
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:42,041
Welcome, Mr. Hartley.

815
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:43,291
First time with us, I see.

816
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:45,458
Have an excellent workout.

817
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:02,458
<i>Brand new.</i>

818
01:41:02,541 --> 01:41:03,833
Man, I'm sorry.

819
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:04,916
Eh.

820
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,583
That's not insanity.

821
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:17,875
What's insane is driving 90 miles
each way to work.

822
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:18,958
Right.

823
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,083
Then going, "This is fucked up.
I hate this. I don't want to do this."

824
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:25,625
Then getting in the car the very next day,
driving 90 miles each way to work.

825
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:27,125
You're absolutely right.

826
01:41:27,208 --> 01:41:29,166
I told you.
You <i>don't</i> listen to me.

827
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,708
You ask, "Yo, Clay.
What about this Bitcoin deal?"

828
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:33,208
"Clay, what's a short sell?"

829
01:41:33,291 --> 01:41:35,833
And I tell you,
and you love that shit.

830
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:38,184
- But this... You're not listening.
- I'm listening.

831
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:40,791
- So what are we doing?
- Come on. Let's go.

832
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:42,875
Oh.

833
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:49,833
Let's go to work.

834
01:41:49,916 --> 01:41:52,434
It's like if you said,
"Let's do laddered intervals."

835
01:41:52,458 --> 01:41:53,500
And I went, "Huh?"

836
01:41:53,583 --> 01:41:56,250
"Ladders? I don't wanna do that."

837
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:36,458
<i>Who needs a Trojan horse
when you've got Postmates?</i>

838
01:43:37,875 --> 01:43:40,208
<i>'Cause everything's airtight</i>

839
01:43:40,291 --> 01:43:43,291
<i>till the billionaire wants
densuke watermelon.</i>

840
01:43:46,708 --> 01:43:50,041
<i>They came for you,
and they weren't about to leave a witness.</i>

841
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:52,916
<i>I was so afraid,
afraid I might say something.</i>

842
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,916
<i>I don't know who they are.</i>

843
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,458
<i>Don't wanna know who you are either.</i>

844
01:43:56,541 --> 01:44:00,458
<i>Consequences, when someone's
wide of the mark, are automatic.</i>

845
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:03,875
<i>- I guess I</i> am <i>begging.
- You picked the wrong house.</i>

846
01:44:03,958 --> 01:44:06,750
<i>When you shouldered
your weapon, and somehow...</i>

847
01:44:07,833 --> 01:44:08,750
<i>...missed.</i>

848
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:44,750
<i>Once I see his eyes,</i>

849
01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:48,333
<i>I'll have a pretty good idea
how this is gonna go.</i>

850
01:44:56,583 --> 01:44:59,375
There must be
some applicable tax burden offset.

851
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:02,291
And I <i>simply</i> expect to see
heaven and earth moving.

852
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:03,791
He-<i>- Hey!</i>

853
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:06,541
I'm not going to be disappointed in <i>you.</i>

854
01:45:06,625 --> 01:45:08,625
I'll be disappointed in me
and everyone involved

855
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:10,375
for not having replaced you soon...

856
01:45:12,291 --> 01:45:13,291
<i>Who the fu...</i>

857
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:15,250
<i>How did you...</i>

858
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:16,750
Okay.

859
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:19,708
Uh... Uh...

860
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:21,208
I...

861
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:25,750
I'll call you back, Marvin.

862
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:28,458
Uh... Uh...

863
01:45:28,541 --> 01:45:30,125
<i>Gotta</i> call back, Marv.

864
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:33,791
I'm <i>fucking</i> hanging up.

865
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:34,875
I...

866
01:45:37,333 --> 01:45:39,333
So nobody gets crazy.

867
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:45,083
I didn't notice the, uh...

868
01:45:45,166 --> 01:45:46,250
I'm <i>all</i> ears.

869
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:53,000
Secure building, eh?
Christmas bonuses'll be light this year.

870
01:45:54,583 --> 01:45:55,583
I, uh...

871
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I don't keep cash here.

872
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:01,958
But I can have some delivered. <i>No?</i>

873
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:05,750
Okay, well, what is it <i>exactly</i>
I can do for you?

874
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:10,333
I came to show you how easily
one might get to you, Mr. Claybourne.

875
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:13,458
And to ask, <i>do you and I have a problem?</i>

876
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:16,125
Do <i>we...</i> What? A problem?

877
01:46:16,208 --> 01:46:18,208
No, of course not.

878
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:21,500
Am I <i>supposed</i> to know who you are?

879
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:25,250
Because my memory for names
and faces isn't what it used to be.

880
01:46:34,833 --> 01:46:35,958
All right.

881
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:44,208
There's an address.

882
01:46:44,708 --> 01:46:47,500
It's 3 Rue du Grev...

883
01:46:48,416 --> 01:46:50,125
I'm still not...

884
01:46:53,375 --> 01:46:54,416
Oh.

885
01:46:55,083 --> 01:46:57,166
Oh.

886
01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:58,500
Wait.

887
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:02,875
<i>You.</i>

888
01:47:06,083 --> 01:47:07,750
I didn't <i>realize.</i>

889
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:09,958
Please hear me out.

890
01:47:10,041 --> 01:47:12,500
To answer your question,
we have <i>no</i> problem.

891
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:16,041
I harbor no ill will
about anything that may have happened.

892
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:17,166
Or not happened.

893
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:19,583
Let me make that crystal clear.

894
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:25,250
Right after the, uh... <i>incident,</i>
I received a phone call.

895
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:28,750
I was told that things had gone sideways.

896
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:32,041
My response was, "Nobody's perfect."

897
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:37,166
Now, I did, <i>I admit,</i> inquire as to what
is normally done in these circumstances.

898
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:40,666
And they... he, <i>the lawyer fella,</i> Hedges,

899
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:43,208
suggested that in this very rare case,

900
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:47,458
I might wish to arrange for insurance
to prevent any <i>blowback.</i>

901
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:48,791
I remember thinking,

902
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:51,916
"Now, why in the world
is this liability mine?"

903
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,833
I mean, you have to please understand
this entire...

904
01:47:56,333 --> 01:47:58,541
I was very <i>new</i> to this kind of thing.

905
01:47:58,625 --> 01:48:02,666
I bled a little ink, so <i>yeah.</i>
Selfishly, I didn't want any blowback.

906
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:06,541
And so, eventually,
we agreed that for an <i>additional</i> 150k

907
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:08,500
the trail could be <i>scrubbed.</i>

908
01:48:08,583 --> 01:48:11,666
That was literally all I was told.
"Cleanup on aisle three."

909
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,500
His words, not mine.

910
01:48:13,583 --> 01:48:16,458
And so, I made sure
there was enough in escrow

911
01:48:16,541 --> 01:48:18,375
and never thought about it again.

912
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:19,875
<i>Until...</i>

913
01:48:23,541 --> 01:48:27,625
What I'm trying to say here,
and I can't express this strongly enough,

914
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:30,291
I have <i>no</i> issue with you.

915
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:31,500
Zero.

916
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:34,208
As far as I'm concerned,

917
01:48:35,875 --> 01:48:37,125
we're good.

918
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,291
I'm curious.

919
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:44,708
I break into your home

920
01:48:44,791 --> 01:48:47,208
in the middle of the night
with a <i>silenced</i> pistol,

921
01:48:48,041 --> 01:48:51,458
and you have <i>no</i> idea why I might be here?

922
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:00,041
If I have to come back,

923
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:04,375
maybe a radioactive speck
on the lip of your favorite coffee mug.

924
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:09,500
A slow death, mind you,
from painful facial necrosis.

925
01:49:09,583 --> 01:49:13,458
Or a tragic misstep
into your penthouse elevator shaft.

926
01:49:13,541 --> 01:49:14,833
But I <i>promise,</i>

927
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:17,541
I'll find something fitting.

928
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,166
<i>The need to feel secure.</i>

929
01:50:09,833 --> 01:50:11,416
<i>It's a slippery slope.</i>

930
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:19,708
<i>Fate is a placebo.</i>

931
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:27,000
<i>The only life path...</i>

932
01:50:27,083 --> 01:50:28,333
<i>the one behind you.</i>

933
01:50:33,291 --> 01:50:36,625
<i>If, in the brief time we're all given,</i>

934
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:38,833
<i>you can't accept this,</i>

935
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,916
<i>well, maybe you're not one of the few.</i>

936
01:50:51,458 --> 01:50:53,375
<i>Maybe you're just like me.</i>

937
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:58,791
